Try it, and you're surely encounter head-scratchingly weird ways that authors have reported even simple analyses, like basic group comparisons. When you encounter this sort of thing, you have two paths: you can despair, curse, and/or throw things, or you can view the studies as curious little puzzles---brain-teasers, if you will---to keep you awake and prevent you from losing track of those notes you took during your stats courses, back when. Here's one of those curious little puzzles, which I recently encountered in helping a colleague with a meta-analysis project.\n\nA researcher conducts a randomized experiment, assigning participants to each of $G$ groups. Each participant is assessed on a variable $Y$ at pre-test and at post-test (we can assume there's no attrition). In their study write-up, the researcher reports sample sizes for each group, means and standard deviations for each group at pre-test and at post-test, and _adjusted_ means at post-test, where the adjustment is done using a basic analysis of covariance, controlling for pre-test scores only. The data layout looks like this:\n\n| Group | $N$ | Pre-test $M$ | Pre-test $SD$ | Post-test $M$ | Post-test $SD$ | Adjusted post-test $M$    |\n|-------|-----|--------------|---------------|---------------|----------------|---------------------------|\n| Group A | $n_A$    | $\\bar{x}_{A}$ | $s_{A0}$ | $\\bar{y}_{A}$ | $s_{A1}$       | $\\tilde{y}_A$          |\n| Group B | $n_B$    | $\\bar{x}_{B}$ | $s_{B0}$ | $\\bar{y}_{B}$ | $s_{B1}$       | $\\tilde{y}_B$          |\n| $\\vdots$    | $\\vdots$ | $\\vdots$      | $\\vdots$ | $\\vdots$      | $\\vdots$       | $\\vdots$           |\n\nNote that the write-up does _not_ provide an estimate of the correlation between the pre-test and the post-test, nor does it report a standard deviation or standard error for the mean change-score between pre-test and post-test within each group. All we have are the summary statistics, plus the adjusted post-test scores. We can assume that the adjustment was done according to the basic ANCOVA model, assuming a common slope across groups as well as homoskedasticity and so on. The model is then\n$$\ny_{ig} = \\alpha_g + \\beta x_{ig} + e_{ig},\n$$\nfor $i = 1,...,n_g$ and $g = 1,...,G$, where $e_{ig}$ is an independent error term that is assumed to have constant variance across groups. \n\n### For realz?\n\nHere's an example with real data, drawn from Table 2 of [Murawski (2006)](https://doi.org/10.1080/10573560500455703): \n\n| Group | $N$ | Pre-test $M$ | Pre-test $SD$ | Post-test $M$ | Post-test $SD$ | Adjusted post-test $M$    |\n|-------|-----|--------------|---------------|---------------|----------------|---------------------------|\n| Group A | 25    | 37.48 | 4.64 | 37.96 | 4.35 | 37.84 |\n| Group B | 26    | 36.85 | 5.18 | 36.46 | 3.86 | 36.66 |\n| Group C | 16    | 37.88 | 3.88 | 37.38 | 4.76 | 36.98 |\n\nThat study reported this information for each of several outcomes, with separate analyses for each of two sub-groups (LD and NLD). The text also reports that they used a two-level hierarchical linear model for the ANCOVA adjustment. For simplicity, let's just ignore the hierarchical linear model aspect and assume that it's a straight, one-level ANCOVA.\n\n## The puzzler\n\nCalculate an estimate of the standardized mean difference between group $B$ and group $A$, along with the sampling variance of the SMD estimate, that adjusts for pre-test differences between groups. Candidates for numerator of the SMD include the adjusted mean difference, $\\tilde{y}_B - \\tilde{y}_A$ or the difference-in-differences, $\\left(\\bar{y}_B - \\bar{x}_B\\right) - \\left(\\bar{y}_A - \\bar{x}_A\\right)$. In either case, the tricky bit is finding the sampling variance of this quantity, which involves the pre-post correlation. For the denominator of the SMD, you use the post-test SD, either pooled across just groups $A$ and $B$ or pooled across all $G$ groups, assuming a common population variance. \n\n## The solution\n\nThe key here is to recognize that you can calculate $\\hat\\beta$, the estimated slope of the within-group pre-post relationship, based on the difference between the adjusted group means and the raw post-test means. Then the pre-post correlation can be derived from the $\\hat\\beta$. In the ANCOVA model,\n$$\n\\tilde{y}_g = \\bar{y}_g - \\hat\\beta \\left(\\bar{x}_g - \\bar{\\bar{x}}\\right),\n$$\nwhere $\\bar{\\bar{x}}$ is the overall mean across groups, or \n$$\n\\bar{\\bar{x}} = \\frac{1}{n_{\\bullet}} \\sum_{g=1}^G n_g \\bar{x}_g,\n$$\nwith $n_{\\bullet} = \\sum_{g=1}^{G} n_g$. Thus, we can back out $\\hat\\beta$ from the reported summary statistics for group $g$ as\n$$\n\\hat\\beta_g = \\frac{\\bar{y}_g - \\tilde{y}_g}{\\bar{x}_g - \\bar{\\bar{x}}}.\n$$\nActually, we get $G$ estimates of $\\hat\\beta_g$---one from each group. Taking a weighted average seems sensible here, so we end up with\n$$\n\\hat\\beta = \\frac{1}{n_{\\bullet}} \\sum_{g=1}^G n_g \\left(\\frac{\\bar{y}_g - \\tilde{y}_g}{\\bar{x}_g - \\bar{\\bar{x}}}\\right).\n$$\nNow, let $r$ denote the sample correlation between pre-test and post-test, after partialing out differences in means for each group. This correlation is related to $\\hat\\beta$ as \n$$\nr = \\hat\\beta \\times \\frac{s_{px}}{s_{py}},\n$$\nwhere $s_{px}$ and $s_{py}$ are the standard deviations of the pre-test and post-test, respectively, pooled across all $g$ groups.\n\nHere's the result of carrying out these calculations with the example data from Murawski (2006):\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nlibrary(dplyr)\n\ndat <- tibble(\n  Group = c(\"A\",\"B\",\"C\"),\n  N = c(25, 26, 16),\n  m_pre = c(37.48, 36.85, 37.88),\n  sd_pre = c(4.64, 5.18, 3.88),\n  m_post = c(37.96, 36.46, 37.38),\n  sd_post = c(4.35, 3.86, 4.76),\n  m_adj = c(37.84, 36.66, 36.98)\n)\n\ncorr_est <- \n  dat %>%\n  mutate(\n    m_pre_pooled = weighted.mean(m_pre, w = N),\n    beta_hat = (m_post - m_adj) / (m_pre - m_pre_pooled)\n  ) %>%\n  summarise(\n    df = sum(N - 1),\n    s_sq_x = sum((N - 1) * sd_pre^2) / df,\n    s_sq_y = sum((N - 1) * sd_post^2) / df,\n    beta_hat = weighted.mean(beta_hat, w = N)\n  ) %>%\n  mutate(\n    r = beta_hat * sqrt(s_sq_x / s_sq_y)\n  )\n\ncorr_est\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stdout}\n\n```\n# A tibble: 1 Ã— 5\n     df s_sq_x s_sq_y beta_hat     r\n  <dbl>  <dbl>  <dbl>    <dbl> <dbl>\n1    64   22.1   18.2    0.636 0.700\n```\n\n\n:::\n:::\n\n\nFrom here, we can calculate the numerator of the SMD a few different ways. \n\n### Diff-in-diff\n\nOne option would be to take the between-group difference in pre-post differences (a.k.a., the diff-in-diff):\n$$\nDD = (\\bar{y}_B - \\bar{x}_B) - (\\bar{y}_A - \\bar{x}_A).\n$$\nAssuming that the within-group variance of the pre-test and the within-group variance of the post-test are equal (and constant across groups), then \n$$\n\\text{Var}(DD) = 2\\sigma^2(1 - \\rho)\\left(\\frac{1}{n_A} + \\frac{1}{n_B}\\right),\n$$\nwhere $\\sigma^2$ is the within-group population variance of the post-test and $\\rho$ is the population correlation between pre- and post. Dividing $DD$ by $s_{py}$ gives an estimate of the standardized mean difference between group B and group A,\n$$\nd_{DD} = \\frac{DD}{s_{py}},\n$$\nwith approximate sampling variance\n$$\n\\text{Var}(d_{DD}) \\approx 2(1 - \\rho)\\left(\\frac{1}{n_A} + \\frac{1}{n_B}\\right) + \\frac{\\delta^2}{2(n_\\bullet - G)},\n$$\nwhere $\\delta$ is the SMD parameter. The variance can be estimated by substituting estimates of $\\rho$ and $\\delta$:\n$$\nV_{DD} = 2(1 - r)\\left(\\frac{1}{n_A} + \\frac{1}{n_B}\\right) + \\frac{d^2}{2(n_\\bullet - G)}.\n$$\nIf you would prefer to pool the post-test standard deviation across groups $A$ and $B$ only, then replace $(n_\\bullet - G)$ with $(n_A + n_B - 2)$ in the second term of $V_{DD}$.\n\n### Regression adjustment\n\nAn alternative to the diff-in-diff approach is to use the regression-adjusted mean difference between group $B$ and group $A$ as the numerator of the SMD. Here, we would calculate the standardized mean difference as \n$$\nd_{reg} = \\frac{\\tilde{y}_B - \\tilde{y}_A}{s_{py}}.\n$$\nNow, the variance of the regression-adjusted mean difference is approximately\n$$\n\\text{Var}(\\tilde{y}_B - \\tilde{y}_A) \\approx \\sigma^2 (1 - \\rho^2) \\left(\\frac{1}{n_A} + \\frac{1}{n_B}\\right), \n$$\nfrom which it follows that the variance of the regression-adjusted SMD is approximately\n$$\n\\text{Var}(d_{reg}) \\approx (1 - \\rho^2)\\left(\\frac{1}{n_A} + \\frac{1}{n_B}\\right) + \\frac{\\delta^2}{2(n_\\bullet - G)}.\n$$\nAgain, the variance can be estimated by substituting estimates of $\\rho$ and $\\delta$:\n$$\nV_{reg} = (1 - r^2)\\left(\\frac{1}{n_A} + \\frac{1}{n_B}\\right) + \\frac{d^2}{2(n_\\bullet - G)}.\n$$\nIf you would prefer to pool the post-test standard deviation across groups $A$ and $B$ only, then replace $(n_\\bullet - G)$ with $(n_A + n_B - 2)$ in the second term of $V_{DD}$.\n\nThe regression-adjusted effect size estimator will always have smaller sampling variance than the diff-in-diff estimator (under the assumptions given above) and so it would seem to be generally preferable. The main reason I could see for using the diff-in-diff estimator is if it was the only thing that could be calculated for the other studies included in a synthesis. \n\n### Numerical example\n\nHere I calculate both estimates and their corresponding variances with the example data from Murawski (2006):\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\ndiffs <- \n  dat %>%\n  filter(Group %in% c(\"A\",\"B\")) %>%\n  summarise(\n    diff_pre = diff(m_pre),\n    diff_post = diff(m_post),\n    diff_adj = diff(m_adj),\n    inv_n = sum(1 / N)\n  )\n\nd_est <-\n  diffs %>%\n  mutate(\n    d_DD = (diff_post - diff_pre) / sqrt(corr_est$s_sq_y),\n    V_DD = 2 * (1 - corr_est$r) * inv_n + d_DD^2 / (2 * corr_est$df),\n    d_reg = diff_adj / sqrt(corr_est$s_sq_y),\n    V_reg = (1 - corr_est$r^2) * inv_n + d_DD^2 / (2 * corr_est$df),\n  )\n\nd_est %>%\n  select(d_DD, V_DD, d_reg, V_reg)\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stdout}\n\n```\n# A tibble: 1 Ã— 4\n    d_DD   V_DD  d_reg  V_reg\n   <dbl>  <dbl>  <dbl>  <dbl>\n1 -0.204 0.0474 -0.276 0.0403\n```\n\n\n:::\n:::\n\nThe effect size estimates are rather discrepant, which is a bit worrisome. \n",
