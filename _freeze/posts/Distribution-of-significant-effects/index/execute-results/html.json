This problem interests me because it connects to the issue of selective reporting of study results, which creates problems for meta-analysis. \nHere, I'll re-state the problem in slightly more general terms and then make some notes about what's going on. \n\nConsider a study that assesses some effect size across $m$ different outcomes. (We'll be thinking about one study at a time here, so no need to index the study as we would in a meta-analysis problem.) Let $T_i$ denote the effect size estimate for outcome $i$, let $V_i$ denote the sampling variance of the effect size estimate for outcome $i$, and let $\\theta_i$ denote the true effect size parameter for corresponding to outcome $i$. Assume that the study outcomes $\\left[T_i\\right]_{i=1}^m$ follow a correlated-and-hierarchical effects model, in which\n$$T_i = \\mu + u + v_i + e_i,$$\nwhere the study-level error $u \\sim N\\left(0,\\tau^2\\right)$, the effect-specific error $v_i \\stackrel{iid}{\\sim} N\\left(0, \\omega^2\\right)$, and the vector of sampling errors $\\left[e_i\\right]_{i=1}^m$ is multivariate normal with mean $\\mathbf{0}$, known variances $\\text{Var}(e_i) = \\sigma^2$, and compound symmetric correlation structure $\\text{cor}(e_h, e_i) = \\rho$. \n\nDefine $A_i$ as an indicator that is equal to one if $T_i$ is statistically significant at level $\\alpha$ based on a one-sided test, and otherwise equal to zero. (Equivalently, let $A_i$ be equal to one if the effect is statistically significant at level $2 \\alpha$ and in the theoretically expected direction.) Formally, \n$$A_i = I\\left(\\frac{T_i}{\\sigma} > q_\\alpha \\right)$$\nwhere $q_\\alpha = \\Phi^{-1}(1 - \\alpha)$ is the critical value from a standard normal distribution (e.g., $q_{.05} = 1.645$, $q_{.025} = 1.96$). Let $N_A = \\sum_{i=1}^m A_i$ denote the total number of statistically significant effect sizes in the study. The question is: what is the distribution of $N_A$.\n\n## Compound symmetry to the rescue\n\nAs I noted in the previous post, this set-up means that the effect size estimates have a compound symmetric distribution. We can make this a bit more explicit by writing the sampling errors in terms of the sum of a component that's common acrosss outcomes and a component that's specific to each outcome. Thus, let $e_i = f + g_i$, where $f \\sim N\\left(0, \\rho \\sigma^2 \\right)$ and $g_i \\stackrel{iid}{\\sim} N \\left(0, (1 - \\rho) \\sigma^2\\right)$. Let me also define $\\zeta = \\mu + u + f$ as the conditional mean of the effects. It then follows that the effect size estimates are _conditionally independent_, given the common components:\n$$\n\\left(T_i | \\zeta \\right) \\stackrel{iid}{\\sim} N\\left(\\zeta, \\omega^2 + (1 - \\rho) \\sigma^2\\right)\n$$\nFurthermore, the conditional probability of a significant effect is\n$$\n\\text{Pr}(A_i = 1 | \\zeta) = \\Phi\\left(\\frac{\\zeta - q_{\\alpha} \\sigma}{\\sqrt{\\omega^2 + (1 - \\rho)\\sigma^2}}\\right)\n$$\nand $A_1,...,A_m$ are mutually independent, conditional on $\\zeta$. Therefore, the conditional distribution of $N_A$ is binomial,\n$$\n\\left(N_A | \\zeta\\right) \\sim Bin(m, \\pi)\n$$\nwhere \n$$\n\\pi = \\Phi\\left(\\frac{\\zeta - q_{\\alpha} \\sigma}{\\sqrt{\\omega^2 + (1 - \\rho)\\sigma^2}}\\right). \n$$\nWhat about the unconditional distribution?\n\nTo get rid of the $\\zeta$, we need to integrate over its distribution, which leads to \n$$\n\\text{Pr}(N_A = a) = \\text{E}\\left[\\text{Pr}\\left(N_A | \\zeta\\right)\\right] = \\int f_{N_A}\\left(a | \\zeta, \\omega, \\sigma, \\rho, m\\right) \\times f_\\zeta(\\zeta | \\mu, \\tau, \\sigma, \\rho) \\ d \\zeta,\n$$\nwhere $f_{N_A}\\left(a | \\zeta, \\omega, \\sigma, \\rho \\right)$ is a binomial density with size $m$ and probability $\\pi = \\pi(\\zeta, \\omega, \\sigma, \\rho)$ and $f_\\zeta(\\zeta | \\mu, \\tau, \\sigma, \\rho)$ is a normal density with mean $\\mu$ and variance $\\tau^2 + \\rho \\sigma^2$. \n\nThis distribution is what you might call a binomial-normal convolution or a random-intercept probit model (where the random intercept is $\\zeta$). As far as I know, the distribution cannot be evaluated analytically but instead must be calculated using some sort of numerical integration routine.

Marginally, $T_i$ is normally distributed with mean $\\mu$ and variance $\\tau^2 + \\omega^2 + \\sigma^2$, so $\\text{Pr}(A_i = 1) = \\psi$, where\n$$\n\\psi = \\Phi\\left(\\frac{\\mu - q_{\\alpha} \\sigma}{\\sqrt{\\tau^2 + \\omega^2 + \\sigma^2}}\\right).\n$$\nBy the linearity of expectations,\n$$\n\\text{E}(N_A) = \\sum_{i=1}^m \\text{E}(A_i) = m \\psi.\n$$\n\nWe can also get an approximation for the variance of $N_A$ by working with its conditional distribution above. By the rule of variance decomposition,\n$$\n\\begin{aligned}\n\\text{Var}(N_A) &= \\text{E}\\left[\\text{Var}\\left(N_A | \\zeta\\right)\\right] + \\text{Var}\\left[\\text{E}\\left(N_A | \\zeta\\right)\\right] \\\\\n&= m \\times \\text{E}\\left[\\pi (1 - \\pi)\\right] + m^2 \\times \\text{Var}\\left[\\pi\\right]\\\\\n&= m \\times \\text{E}\\left[\\pi\\right] \\left(1 - \\text{E}\\left[\\pi\\right]\\right) + m (m - 1) \\times \\text{Var}\\left[\\pi\\right],\n\\end{aligned}\n$$\nwhere $\\pi$ is, as defined above, a function of $\\zeta$ and thus a random variable. Now, $\\text{E}(\\pi) = \\psi$ and we can get something close to $\\text{Var}(\\pi)$ using a first-order approximation:\n$$\n\\text{Var}\\left(\\pi\\right) \\approx \\left(\\left.\\frac{\\delta \\pi}{\\delta \\zeta}\\right|_{\\zeta = \\mu}\\right)^2 \\times \\text{Var}\\left(\\zeta\\right) = \\left[\\phi\\left(\\frac{\\mu - q_{\\alpha} \\sigma}{\\sqrt{\\omega^2 + (1 - \\rho)\\sigma^2}}\\right)\\right]^2 \\times \\frac{\\tau^2 + \\rho \\sigma^2}{\\omega^2 + (1 - \\rho)\\sigma^2}.\n$$\nThus,\n$$\n\\begin{aligned}\n\\text{Var}(N_A) \\approx m \\times \\psi \\left(1 - \\psi\\right) + m (m - 1) \\times \\left[\\phi\\left(\\frac{\\mu - q_{\\alpha} \\sigma}{\\sqrt{\\omega^2 + (1 - \\rho)\\sigma^2}}\\right)\\right]^2 \\times \\frac{\\tau^2 + \\rho \\sigma^2}{\\omega^2 + (1 - \\rho)\\sigma^2}.\n\\end{aligned}\n$$\nIf the amount of common variation is small, so $\\tau^2$ is near zero and $\\rho$ is near zero, then the contribution of the second term will be small, and $N_A$ will act more or less like a binomial random variable with size $m$ and probability $\\psi$. On the other hand, if the amount of independent variation in the effect sizes is small, so $\\omega^2$ is near zero and $\\rho$ is near 1, then the term on the right will approach $m(m - 1)\\psi(1 - \\psi)$ and $\\text{Var}\\left(N_A\\right)$ will approach $m^2 \\psi(1 - \\psi)$, or the variance of $m$ times a single Bernoulli variate. So you could say that $N_A$ has anywhere between $1$ and $m$ variate's worth of information in it, depending on the degree of correlation between the effect size estimates. \n",
