The step-function model uses a piece-wise constant function with level shifts at specific, analyst-specified significance thresholds (see @fig-step-fun). \nThe beta-density model instead uses...wait for it...a beta density kernel function, which can take on a variety of smooth shapes over the unit interval (see @fig-beta-dens).\n\n::: {.column-body-outset layout-ncol=2}\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![Two-step selection model with $\\lambda_1 = 0.6, \\lambda_2 = 0.4$](index_files/figure-html/fig-step-fun-1.png){#fig-step-fun width=480}\n:::\n:::\n\n::: {.cell}\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![Beta-density selection model with $\\lambda_1 = 0.5, \\lambda_2 = 0.9$](index_files/figure-html/fig-beta-dens-1.png){#fig-beta-dens width=480}\n:::\n:::\n\n\n:::\n\nIn the original formulation of the beta density model, the selection function is given by\n$$\n\\text{Pr}(O_i^* = 1 | p_i^*) = \\left(p_i^*\\right)^{(\\lambda_1 - 1)} \\left(1 - p_i^*\\right)^{(\\lambda_2 - 1)},\n$$\nwhere $O_i^*$ be a binary indicator equal to 1 if $T_i^*$ is reported and $p_i^* = 1 - \\Phi\\left(T_i^* / \\sigma_i^*\\right)$ is the one-sided p-value corresponding to the effect size estimate.\nThe parameters $\\lambda_1$ and $\\lambda_2$ must be strictly greater than zero, and $\\lambda_1 = \\lambda_2 = 1$ corresponds to a constant probability of selection (i.e., no selective reporting bias).\n\nIn proposing the model, @Citkowicz2017parsimonious argued that the beta-density function provides a parsimonious expression of more complex forms of selective reporting than can easily be captured by a step function. \nFor instance, the beta density in @fig-beta-dens is smoothly declining from $p < .005$ through the psychologically salient thresholds $p = .025$ and $p = .05$ and beyond. In order to approximate such a smooth curve with a step function, one would have to use many thresholds and therefore many more than the two parameters of the beta density.\n\nAlthough using smoothly varying selection probabilities may seem appealing, the beta density also comes with an important limitation, highlighted in a commentary by @hedges2017plausibility. For some parameter values, the beta density implies selection probabilities that differ by many orders of magnitude. These extreme differences in selection probability can imply implausible selection processes, in which hundreds of non-significant effect size estimates would need to go unreported to observe a sample of a few dozen findings. Extreme differences in selection probabilities make the model highly sensitive to the inclusion or exclusion of some effect size estimates because the influence of each estimate is driven by the inverse of its selection probability [@hedges2017plausibility]. \n\n\n\n",
