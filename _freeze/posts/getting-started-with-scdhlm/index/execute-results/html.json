You'll need to have a [copy of R installed](https://cran.r-project.org/). There are two ways to do the installation: through the Comprehensive R Archive Network (CRAN) or from the source code on Github. I describe each approach in turn.\n\n### Option 1: Via CRAN\n\nGo via CRAN to install the most recent stable version of the package. Type the following commands at the R prompt:\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\ninstall.packages(\"scdhlm\")\nlibrary(scdhlm)\n```\n:::\n\n\n### Option 2: Via Github\n\nGo via Github to get the latest development version of the package. For this option, you will first need to install the devtools package:\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\ninstall.packages(\"devtools\")\n```\n:::\n\n\nOnce you have successfully installed this package, type the following:\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nlibrary(devtools)\ninstall_github(\"jepusto/scdhlm\")\nlibrary(scdhlm)\n```\n:::\n\n\n### Further instructions\n\nYou'll only need to do the installation once. Once you've got the package installed, type the following in order to access the package within an R session: `library(scdhlm)`. \n\nTo open the package documentation, type `package?scdhlm`. To access the documentation for an individual function in this package, just type `?` followed by the name of the function. For instance, one of the main functions in the package is called `g_REML`; to access its documentation, type `?g_REML`.\n\n### web-interface for calculating effect sizes\n\nThe package includes an interactive app (written with `shiny`) for calculating design-comparable standardized mean differences. To run this app on your computer, you will first need to [install RStudio](https://www.rstudio.com/products/rstudio/download/) (if you don't already have it). Then ensure that you have the `shiny`, `markdown`, and `ggplot2` packages installed by running the following:  \n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\ninstall.packages(\"shiny\")\ninstall.packages(\"markdown\")\ninstall.packages(\"ggplot2\")\n```\n:::\n\n\nFinally, open the app by typing the following at the prompt within RStudio:\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nlibrary(scdhlm)\nshine_scd()\n```\n:::\n\n\nThe app should now open in your web browser. \n",
