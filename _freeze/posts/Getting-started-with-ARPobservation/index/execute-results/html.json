For the time being, ARPobservation is available as a pre-compiled binary for Windows. For Mac/Linux, you'll have to download the source from Github. \n\n1. [Download](http://cran.us.r-project.org/) and install R. R is free, open-source software that is used by many data analysts and statisticians. ARPobservation is a contributed package that runs within R, so you'll need to get the base software first.\n\n2. (Optional but recommended) [Download](http://www.rstudio.com/) and install RStudio, which is a very nice front-end interface to R.\n\n3. Open R or RStudio and type the following sequence of commands in the console:\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\ninstall.packages(\"ARPobservation\")\nlibrary(ARPobservation)\n```\n:::\n\n\nYou'll only need to do the above once. Once you've got the package installed, type the following in order to access the package within an R session: `library(ARPobservation)`. \n\nTo open the package documentation, type `package?ARPobservation`. To access the documentation for an individual function in this package, just type `?` followed by the name of the function. For instance, one of the main functions in the package is called `r_behavior_stream`; to access its documentation, type `?r_behavior_stream`.\n",
