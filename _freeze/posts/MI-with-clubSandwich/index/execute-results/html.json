However, this might not be reasonable when working with test statistics based on cluster-robust variance estimators, which can be imprecise when the number of clusters is small or the design matrix of predictors is unbalanced in certain ways. [Barnard and Rubin (1999)](https://doi.org/10.1093/biomet/86.4.948) proposed a small-sample correction for tests and confidence intervals based on multiple imputed datasets. In this post, I'll show how to implement their technique using the output of `clubSandwich`, with multiple imputations generated using the [`mice` package](https://cran.r-project.org/package=mice). \n\n### Setup\n\nTo begin, let me create missingness in a dataset containing multiple clusters of observations:\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nlibrary(mlmRev)\nlibrary(mice)\nlibrary(dplyr)\n\ndata(bdf)\n\nbdf <- bdf %>%\n  select(schoolNR, IQ.verb, IQ.perf, sex, ses, langPRET, aritPRET, aritPOST) %>%\n  mutate(\n    schoolNR = factor(schoolNR),\n    sex = as.numeric(sex)\n    ) %>%\n  filter(as.numeric(schoolNR) <= 30) %>%\n  droplevels()\n\nbdf_missing <- \n  bdf %>% \n  select(-schoolNR) %>%\n  ampute(run = TRUE)\n\nbdf_missing <- \n  bdf_missing$amp %>%\n  mutate(schoolNR = bdf$schoolNR)\n\nsummary(bdf_missing)\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stdout}\n\n```\n    IQ.verb         IQ.perf            sex             ses      \n Min.   : 4.00   Min.   : 5.333   Min.   :1.000   Min.   :10.0  \n 1st Qu.:10.50   1st Qu.: 9.333   1st Qu.:1.000   1st Qu.:20.0  \n Median :11.50   Median :10.667   Median :1.000   Median :28.0  \n Mean   :11.64   Mean   :10.758   Mean   :1.473   Mean   :28.8  \n 3rd Qu.:13.00   3rd Qu.:12.333   3rd Qu.:2.000   3rd Qu.:38.0  \n Max.   :18.00   Max.   :16.667   Max.   :2.000   Max.   :50.0  \n NA's   :46      NA's   :32       NA's   :39      NA's   :35    \n    langPRET        aritPRET        aritPOST        schoolNR  \n Min.   :15.00   Min.   : 1.00   Min.   : 2.00   40     : 35  \n 1st Qu.:30.00   1st Qu.: 9.00   1st Qu.:12.00   54     : 31  \n Median :34.00   Median :11.00   Median :18.00   55     : 30  \n Mean   :33.89   Mean   :11.63   Mean   :17.74   38     : 28  \n 3rd Qu.:39.00   3rd Qu.:14.00   3rd Qu.:23.00   1      : 25  \n Max.   :48.00   Max.   :20.00   Max.   :30.00   18     : 24  \n NA's   :40      NA's   :34      NA's   :39      (Other):354  \n```\n\n\n:::\n:::\n\n\nNow I'll use `mice` to create 10 multiply imputed datasets:\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nImpute_bdf <- mice(bdf_missing, m=10, meth=\"norm.nob\", seed=24)\n```\n:::\n\n\nAm I imputing while ignoring the hierarchical structure of the data? Yes, yes I am. Is this is a good way to do imputation? Probably not. But this is a quick and dirty example, so we're going to have to live with it. \n\n### Model\n\nSuppose that the goal of our analysis is to estimate the coefficients of the following regression model:\n\n$$\n\\text{aritPOST}_{ij} = \\beta_0 + \\beta_1 \\text{aritPRET}_{ij} + \\beta_2 \\text{langPRET}_{ij} + \\beta_3 \\text{sex}_{ij} + \\beta_4 \\text{SES}_{ij} + e_{ij},\n$$\n\nwhere $i$ indexes students and $j$ indexes schools, and where we allow for the possibility that errors from the same cluster are correlated in an unspecified way. With complete data, we could estimate the model by ordinary least squares and then use `clubSandwich` to get standard errors that are robust to within-cluster dependence and heteroskedasticity. The code for this is as follows:\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nlibrary(clubSandwich)\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stderr}\n\n```\nRegistered S3 method overwritten by 'clubSandwich':\n  method    from    \n  bread.mlm sandwich\n```\n\n\n:::\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nlm_full <- lm(aritPOST ~ aritPRET + langPRET + sex + ses, data = bdf)\ncoef_test(lm_full, cluster = bdf$schoolNR, vcov = \"CR2\")\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stdout}\n\n```\n       Coef.

Rather than using large-sample normal approximations for inference, they derive an approximate degrees-of-freedom that combines uncertainty in the standard errors calculated from each imputed dataset with between-imputation uncertainty. The method is as follows. \n\nSuppose that we have $m$ imputed datasets. Let $\\hat\\beta_{(j)}$ be the estimated regression coefficient from imputed dataset $j$, with (in this case cluster-robust) sampling variance estimate $V_{(j)}$. Further, let $\\eta_{(j)}$ be the degrees of freedom corresponding to $V_{(j)}$. To combine these estimates, calculate the averages across multiply imputed datasets:\n\n$$\n\\bar\\beta = \\frac{1}{m}\\sum_{j=1}^m \\hat\\beta_{(j)}, \\qquad \\bar{V} = \\frac{1}{m}\\sum_{j=1}^m V_{(j)}, \\qquad \\bar\\eta = \\frac{1}{m}\\sum_{j=1}^m \\eta_{(j)}.\n$$\n\nAlso calculate the between-imputation variance \n\n$$\nB = \\frac{1}{m - 1} \\sum_{j=1}^m \\left(\\hat\\beta_{(j)} - \\bar\\beta\\right)^2\n$$\n\nAnd then combine the between- and within- variance estimates using Rubin's rules:\n\n$$\nV_{total} = \\bar{V} + \\frac{m + 1}{m} B.\n$$\n\nThe degrees of freedom associated with $V_{total}$ modify the estimated complete-data degrees of freedom $\\bar\\eta$ using quantities that depend on the fraction of missing information in a coefficient. The fraction of missing information is given by\n\n$$\n\\hat\\gamma_m = \\frac{(m+1)B}{m V_{total}}\n$$\n\nThe degrees of freedom are then given by\n\n$$\n\\nu_{total} = \\left(\\frac{1}{\\nu_m} + \\frac{1}{\\nu_{obs}}\\right)^{-1},\n$$\n\nwhere\n\n$$\n\\nu_m = \\frac{(m - 1)}{\\hat\\gamma_m^2}, \\quad \\text{and} \\quad \\nu_{obs} = \\frac{\\bar\\eta (\\bar\\eta + 1) (1 - \\hat\\gamma)}{\\bar\\eta + 3}.\n$$\n\nHypothesis tests and confidence intervals are based on the approximation\n\n$$\n\\frac{\\bar\\beta - \\beta_0}{\\sqrt{V_{total}}} \\ \\stackrel{\\cdot}{\\sim} \\ t(\\nu_{total})\n$$\n\n### Implementation \n\nHere is how to carry out these calculations using the results of `clubSandwich::coef_test` and a bit of `dplyr`:\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\n# fit results with clubSandwich standard errors\n\nmodels_robust <- with(data = Impute_bdf, \n                      lm(aritPOST ~ aritPRET + langPRET + sex + ses) %>% \n                         coef_test(cluster=bdf$schoolNR, vcov=\"CR2\")\n                      ) \n\n\n# pool results with clubSandwich standard errors\n\nrobust_pooled <- \n  models_robust$analyses %>%\n  \n  # add coefficient names as a column\n  lapply(function(x) {\n    x$coef <- row.names(x)\n    x\n  }) %>%\n  bind_rows() %>%\n  as.data.frame() %>%\n  \n  # summarize by coefficient\n  group_by(coef) %>%\n  summarise(\n    m = n(),\n    B = var(beta),\n    beta_bar = mean(beta),\n    V_bar = mean(SE^2),\n    eta_bar = mean(df)\n  ) %>%\n  \n  mutate(\n    \n    # calculate intermediate quantities to get df\n    V_total = V_bar + B * (m + 1) / m,\n    gamma = ((m + 1) / m) * B / V_total,\n    df_m = (m - 1) / gamma^2,\n    df_obs = eta_bar * (eta_bar + 1) * (1 - gamma) / (eta_bar + 3),\n    df = 1 / (1 / df_m + 1 / df_obs),\n    \n    # calculate summary quantities for output\n    se = sqrt(V_total),\n    t = beta_bar / se,\n    p_val = 2 * pt(abs(t), df = df, lower.tail = FALSE),\n    crit = qt(0.975, df = df),\n    lo95 = beta_bar - se * crit,\n    hi95 = beta_bar + se * crit\n  )\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stderr}\n\n```\nWarning: There were 5 warnings in `summarise()`.\nThe first warning was:\nℹ In argument: `eta_bar = mean(df)`.\nℹ In group 1: `coef = \"(Intercept)\"`.\nCaused by warning in `mean.default()`:\n! argument is not numeric or logical: returning NA\nℹ Run `dplyr::last_dplyr_warnings()` to see the 4 remaining warnings.\n```\n\n\n:::\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nrobust_pooled %>%\n  select(coef, est = beta_bar, se, t, df, p_val, lo95, hi95, gamma) %>%\n  mutate_at(vars(est:gamma), round, 3)\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stdout}\n\n```\n# A tibble: 5 × 9\n  coef           est    se     t    df p_val  lo95  hi95 gamma\n  <chr>        <dbl> <dbl> <dbl> <dbl> <dbl> <dbl> <dbl> <dbl>\n1 (Intercept) -2.72  1.34  -2.03    NA    NA    NA    NA 0.129\n2 aritPRET     0.968 0.088 11.0     NA    NA    NA    NA 0.051\n3 langPRET     0.309 0.032  9.54    NA    NA    NA    NA 0.125\n4 ses          0.03  0.025  1.23    NA    NA    NA    NA 0.096\n5 sex         -1.43  0.518 -2.76    NA    NA    NA    NA 0.104\n```\n\n\n:::\n:::\n\n\n\n\nIt is instructive to compare the calculated `df` to `eta_bar` and `df_m`: \n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nrobust_pooled %>%\n  select(coef, df, df_m, eta_bar) %>%\n  mutate_at(vars(df, df_m, eta_bar), round, 1)\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stdout}\n\n```\n# A tibble: 5 × 4\n  coef           df  df_m eta_bar\n  <chr>       <dbl> <dbl>   <dbl>\n1 (Intercept)    NA  539.

This is by construction. Further `df_m` is the conventional degrees of freedom used in multiple-imputation, which assume that the complete-data estimates are normally distributed, and in this example they are way far off. \n\n### Further thoughts\n\nHow well does this method perform in practice? I'm not entirely sure---I'm just trusting that Barnard and Rubin's approximation is sound and would work in this setting (I mean, they're smart people!). Are there other, better approaches? Totally possible. I have done zero literature review beyond the Barnard and Rubin paper. In any case, exploring the performance of this method (and any other alternatives) seems like it would make for a very nice student project. \n\nThere's also the issue of how to do tests of multi-dimensional constraints (i.e., F-tests). The `clubSandwich` package implements Wald-type tests for multi-dimensional constraints, using a small-sample correction that we developed ([Tipton & Pustejovsky, 2015](http://journals.sagepub.com/doi/abs/10.3102/1076998615606099); [Pustejovsky & Tipton, 2016](http://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/07350015.2016.1247004)). But it would take some further thought to figure out how to handle multiply imputed data with this type of test... \n",
