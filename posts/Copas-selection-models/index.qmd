Recently, I've been working a lot on models for selective reporting of study results in meta-analysis.
I've mostly focused on [step-function selection models](/posts/step-function-selection-models/) [@hedges1992modeling; @vevea1995general; @Hedges1996estimating; @vevea2005publication], which assume that selective reporting of study results is driven fully by the $p$-values of the reported effect size estimates (and specifically, where those $p$-values fall relative to certain thresholds).
This is not the only form of selection model, though.
One prominent alternative model, usually referred to as the Copas selection model, is based on subtly different assumptions than the step-function model.
This model was described in a series of papers by John Copas and colleagues [@copas1997inference; @copas1999what; @copas2000metaanalysis; @Copas2001sensitivity] and has received quite a lot of attention in the literature on meta-analysis of medical and epidemiological research, but relatively little attention from folks focused on meta-analysis of social science research. 
In this post, I'll give an overview of the Copas model and highlight some of the ways that it differs from step function models.
