Last night I attended a joint meetup between the [Austin R User Group](https://www.meetup.com/Austin-R-User-Group/) and [R Ladies Austin](https://www.meetup.com/rladies-austin/), which was great fun. The evening featured several lightning talks on a range of topics, from breaking into data science to network visualization to starting your own blog. I gave a talk about sandwich standard errors and my [clubSandwich R package](/software/clubsandwich). Here are links to some of the talks:
