In today's Quant Methods colloquium, I gave an introduction to the logic and purposes of Monte Carlo simulation studies, with examples written in R. 

* [Here are the slides](/files/Simulations-in-R-2016.html) from my presentation. 
* You can find the code that generates the slides [here](https://gist.github.com/jepusto/bf6cdb6e393f54470ba4d016199c6eb8). 
* Here is my [presentation on the same topic](/Designing-simulation-studies-using-R) from a couple of years ago.
* [David Robinson's blog](http://varianceexplained.org/r/beta_binomial_baseball/) has a much more in-depth discussion of beta-binomial regression.
* The data I used is from [Lahman's baseball database](http://www.seanlahman.com/baseball-database.html).
