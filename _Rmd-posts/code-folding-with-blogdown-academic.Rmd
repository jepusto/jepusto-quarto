__2020-05-03__ This post describes an implementation of code folding for an older version of the Academic Theme. It does not work with Academic 4.+. See [my updated instructions](/code-folding-update/) to get it working with newer versions of Academic.

Rmarkdown documents now have a very nifty [code folding option](https://bookdown.org/yihui/rmarkdown/html-document.html#code-folding), which allows the reader of a compiled html document to toggle whether to view or hide code chunks. However, the feature is [not supported in blogdown](https://github.com/rstudio/blogdown/issues/214), the popular Rmarkdown-based website/blog creation package. I recently ran across an implementation of codefolding for blogdown, developed by [Sébastien Rochette](https://statnmap.com/2017-11-13-enable-code-folding-in-bookdown-and-blogdown/). I have been putzing around, trying to get it to work with my blog, which uses the Hugo [Academic theme](https://sourcethemes.com/academic/)---alas, to no avail. To my amazement and good fortune, Sébastien swooped in with [a pull request](https://github.com/jepusto/jepusto.com/pull/9) that cleaned up my blundering attempts at implementation. Now all of [my posts](/package-downloads) have [working](/handmade-clubSandwich) [code folding](/effective-sample-size-aggregation)!

In this post, I'll lay out how to make Sébastien's code folding feature work with the Academic theme. To be totally clear, all of the hard bits of this were [solved by Sébastien](https://statnmap.com/2017-11-13-enable-code-folding-in-bookdown-and-blogdown/). I don't know javascript to save my life, and my only contribution is to write down the instructions in what I hope is a coherent fashion, so that you too can soon be doing the happy code folding dance if you so desire.

## Code folding with the Academic theme

1. You'll first need to pull in some javascript assets. Create a folder called `js` under the `\static` directory of your site. Add the files `transition.js`, `collapse.js`, and `dropdown.js` from [bootstrap](https://github.com/twbs/bootstrap/tree/v3.3.7/js). 
2. Also add Sébastien's codefolding javascript, [`codefolding.js`](https://github.com/jepusto/jepusto.com/blob/master/static/js/codefolding.js).
3. Create a folder called `css` under the `\static` directory of your site. Add the file [`codefolding.css`](https://github.com/jepusto/jepusto.com/blob/master/static/css/codefolding.css). This is the css for the buttons that will appear on your posts. 
4. Add the file [`article_footer_js.html`](https://github.com/jepusto/jepusto.com/blob/master/layouts/partials/article_footer_js.html) to the `\layouts\partials` directory of your site.
5. Add the file [`header_maincodefolding.html`](https://github.com/jepusto/jepusto.com/blob/master/layouts/partials/header_maincodefolding.html) to the `\layouts\partials` directory of your site.
6. If you do not already have a file `head_custom.html` in the `\layouts\partials` directory, create it.. Add the following lines of code to the file:
    ```{js, eval = FALSE}
    {{ if not .Site.Params.disable_codefolding }}
      <script src="{{ "js/collapse.js" | relURL }}"></script>
      <script src="{{ "js/dropdown.js" | relURL }}"></script>
      <script src="{{ "js/transition.js" | relURL }}"></script>
    {{ end }}
    ```
7. If you do not already have a file `footer.html` in the `\layouts\partials` directory, copy it over from `\themes\hugo-academic\layouts\partials`. Add the following lines of code to it, somewhere towards the bottom (see [my version](https://github.com/jepusto/jepusto.com/blob/master/layouts/partials/footer.html) for example):
    ```{js, eval = FALSE}
    <!-- Init code folding -->
    {{ partial "article_footer_js.html" . }}
    ```
8. If you do not already have the file `single.html` in the directory `\layouts\_default`, copy it over from `\themes\hugo-academic\layouts\_default`. Add the following line of code at an appropriate point so that your posts will include the "Show/hide code" button (I put it after the title, before the meta-data; [see here](https://github.com/jepusto/jepusto.com/blob/master/layouts/_default/single.html)):
    ```{js, eval = FALSE}
     {{ partial "header_maincodefolding" . }}
    ```
9. Modify your `config.toml` file (in the base directory of your site) to include the following lines:
    ```{r, eval = FALSE}
    # Set to true to disable code folding
    disable_codefolding = false
    # Set to "hide" or "show" all codes by default
    codefolding_show = "show"
    # Set to true to exclude the "Show/hide all" button
    codefolding_nobutton = false
    ```
    Also edit the `custom_css` parameter so that the `codefolding.css` file will get loaded:
    ```{r, eval = FALSE}
    custom_css = ["codefolding.css"]
    ```

## Using the codefolding parameters

The `config.toml` file now has three parameters that control code folding:

- `disable_codefolding` controls whether to load the code folding scripts on your site. Set it to `true` to disable code folding globally. 
- `codefolding_show` controls whether code blocks will be shown or hidden by default. If your previous posts have lots of code in them, set the default to `show` to minimize changes in the appearance of your site.
- `codefolding_nobutton` controls whether the "Show/hide code" button will appear at the top of posts that include code blocks. Set it to `true` to disable the button but keep the other code folding functionality. 

The above parameters are defaults for your entire site. To over-ride the defaults, you can also set the parameters in the YAML header of any post: 

- Set `disable_codefolding: true` to turn off code folding for the post.
- Set `codefolding_show: hide` to hide the code blocks in the post (as in [this post](\package-downloads)).
- Set `codefolding_nobutton: true` to turn off the "Show/hide code" button at the top of the post (as in the present post).

I hope these instructions work for you. If not, questions, corrections, and clarifications are welcome. Thanks again to [Sébastien Rochette](https://statnmap.com/) for working out this solution and for graciously troubleshooting my attempt at implementation. Happy blogging, y'all!
