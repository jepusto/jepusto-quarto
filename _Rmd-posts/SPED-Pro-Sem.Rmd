[Dr. Marcia Barnes](http://www.edb.utexas.edu/education/departments/sped/about/fac_dir/barnes/) from the department of Special Education invited me to visit her pro-seminar this afternoon and talk about some of my work on meta-analytic methods for single-case research. Thanks very much to the students for asking such thoughtful and engaging questions. [Here are the slides](/files/Barnes-Pro-Sem-2014-04-10.pdf), which include some additional material that we didn't get to talk about.
