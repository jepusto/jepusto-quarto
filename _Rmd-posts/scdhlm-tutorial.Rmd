I'm pleased to announce that the [Campbell Collaboration](https://www.campbellcollaboration.org/) has just published a new discussion paper that I wrote with my colleagues Jeff Valentine and Emily Tanner-Smith about [between-case standardized mean difference effect sizes for single-case designs](https://campbellcollaboration.org/library/effect-sizes-single-case-designs-campbell-discussion-paper-1.html). 
The paper provides a relatively non-technical introduction to BC-SMD effect sizes and a tutorial on how to use the [scdhlm web-app](https://jepusto.shinyapps.io/scdhlm/) for calculating estimates of the BC-SMD for user-provided data. 
If you have any questions or feedback about the app, please feel free to contact me!
