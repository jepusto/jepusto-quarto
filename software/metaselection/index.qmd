Fits a flexible class of p-value selection models for meta-analysis and meta-regression models, providing standard errors and confidence intervals based on either cluster-robust variance estimators (i.e., sandwich estimators) or cluster-level bootstrapping to handle dependent effect size estimates. 
Supported models include generalizations of the step-function selection model as proposed by [Vevea and Hedges (1995)](https://doi.org/10.1007/BF02294384) and the beta-function selection model as proposed by [Citkowicz and Vevea (2017)](https://doi.org/10.1037/met0000119).
