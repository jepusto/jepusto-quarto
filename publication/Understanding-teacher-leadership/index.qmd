We report ﬁndings from a collaborative research effort designed to examine how teachers act as leaders in their schools. We ﬁnd that teachers educated by the Math in the Middle Institute act as key sources of advice for colleagues within their schools while drawing support from a network consisting of other teachers in the program and university-level advisors. In addition to reporting on our ﬁndings, we reﬂect on our research process, noting some of the practical challenges involved, as well as some of the beneﬁts of collaboration.
