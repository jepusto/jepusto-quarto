To illustrate this technique, we will demonstrate how to bootstrap a Vevea-Hedges selection model.\n\n\n\n\n\nMar 30, 2023\n\n\nJames E.

In these fields, Cohen’s \\(d\\) is so pervasive that its use is nearly automatic, and analysts rarely question its utility or consider alternatives (response ratios, anyone? POMP?). Despite this state of affairs, working with Cohen’s \\(d\\) is theoretically challenging because the standardized mean difference metric does not have a singular definition. Rather, its definition depends on the choice of the standardizing variance used in the denominator.\n\n\n\n\n\nFeb 17, 2023\n\n\nJames E.

We were recently alerted that Theorem 2 in the paper is incorrect as stated. It turns out, the conditions in the original version of the theorem are too general. A more limited version of the Theorem does actually hold, but only for models estimated using ordinary (unweighted) least squares, under a working model that assumes independent, homoskedastic errors. In this post, I’ll give the revised theorem, following the notation and setup of the previous post (so better read that first, or what follows won’t make much sense!).\n\n\n\n\n\nNov 7, 2022\n\n\nJames E.

A careful reader recently alerted us to a problem with Theorem 2 in the paper, which concerns a computational short cut for a certain cluster-robust variance estimator in models with cluster-specific fixed effects. The theorem is incorrect as stated, and we are currently working on issuing a correction for the published version of the paper. In the interim, this post details the problem with Theorem 2. I’ll first review the CR2 variance estimator, then describe the assertion of the theorem, and then provide a numerical counter-example demonstrating that the assertion is not correct as stated.\n\n\n\n\n\nSep 28, 2022\n\n\nJames E.

I think this is an interesting question because, while the SMD could work perfectly fine as an effect size metric for proportions, there are also other alternatives that could be considered, such as odds ratios or response ratios or raw differences in proportions. Further, there are some situations where the SMD has disadvantages for synthesizing contrasts between proportions. Thus, it’s a situation where one has to make a choice about the effect size metric, and where the most common metric (the SMD) might not be the right answer. In this post, I want to provide a bit more detail regarding why I think mean-variance relationships in raw data can signal that the standardized mean differences might be less useful as an effect size metric compared to alternatives.\n\n\n\n\n\nNov 2, 2021\n\n\nJames E.

In the same spirit as my previous post on the Woodbury identity, I thought I would share my notes on another helpful bit of math about matrices. At some point in high school or college, you might have learned how to invert a small matrix by hand. It turns out that there’s a straight-forward generalization of this formula to matrices of arbitrary size, but that are partitioned into four pieces.\n\n\n\n\n\nOct 20, 2021\n\n\nJames E.

When a version of the question came up recently on the R-sig-meta-analysis listserv, Dr. Wolfgang Viechtbauer offered a whole blog post in reply, demonstrating how weights work in simpler fixed effect and random effects meta-analysis and then how things get more complicated in multivariate models. In this post, I’ll try to add some further intuition on how weights work in certain multivariate meta-analysis models. Most of the discussion will apply to models that include multiple level of random effects, but no predictors. I’ll also comment briefly on meta-regression models with only study-level predictor variables, and finally give some pointers to work on more complicated models.\n\n\n\n\n\nJun 9, 2020\n\n\nJames E.

    "text": "Supplementary materials  Journal  Pre-Print\nMethods for meta-analyzing single-case designs (SCDs) are needed to inform evidence-based practice in clinical and school settings and to draw broader and more defensible generalizations in areas where SCDs comprise a large part of the research base. The most widely used outcomes in single-case research are measures of behavior collected using systematic direct observation, which typically take the form of rates or proportions. For studies that use such measures, one simple and intuitive way to quantify effect sizes is in terms of proportionate change from baseline, using an effect size known as the log response ratio. This paper describes methods for estimating log response ratios and combining the estimates using meta-analysis. The methods are based on a simple model for comparing two phases, where the level of the outcome is stable within each phase and the repeated outcome measurements are independent. Although auto-correlation will lead to biased estimates of the sampling variance of the effect size, meta-analysis of response ratios can be conducted with robust variance estimation procedures that remain valid even when sampling variance estimates are biased. The methods are demonstrated using data from a recent meta-analysis on group contingency interventions for student problem behavior."

    "text": "White paper  PDF\nTexas House Bill 5 introduced requirements that school districts partner with institutions of higher education to provide college preparatory courses in mathematics and English for high school seniors who are not yet college ready. As districts and college partners begin to respond to these provisions, there is a need for empirical research on the effects of different approaches to implementing the college preparatory courses. In response to House Bill 5 requirements, the Charles A. Dana Center has developed a model college preparatory mathematics course, Transition to College Mathematics Course (TCMC), which has been adopted by dozens of school districts across Texas over the past several school years. We examine the effects of TCMC on students’ progress into post-secondary education by comparing students who participated in TCMC during the 2017-18 school year (the second year of implementation) to observationally similar students from the same cohort but who did not enroll in the course. We find that students who took TCMC graduated at higher rates than comparison students. They had similar rates of overall enrollment in post-secondary education, but enrolled in community colleges at higher rates and in 4-year colleges or universities at lower rates than did comparison students. Enrollment tended to increase over the course of four semesters after high school graduation. Relative to comparison students, students who took TCMC were also less likely to take and less likely to pass college-level math coursework. These results must be interpreted cautiously because we were unable to fully assess and account for students’ college-readiness status at the start of their senior year."

Although visual analysis is typically the first and main method for primary analysis of data from SCDs, quantitative methods are useful for synthesizing results and drawing systematic generalizations across bodies of single-case research. Researchers who are interested in synthesizing findings across SCDs and between-group designs might consider using the between-case standardized mean difference (BC-SMD) effect size, which aims to put results from both types of studies into a common metric. Current BC-SMD methods are limited to treatment reversal design and across-participant multiple baseline design, yet more complex designs are used in practice. In this study, we extend available BC-SMD methods to several variations of the multiple baseline design, including the replicated multiple baseline across behaviors or settings, the clustered multiple baseline design, and the multivariate multiple baseline across participants. For each variation, we describe methods for estimating BC-SMD effect sizes and illustrate our proposed approach by re-analyzing data from a published SCD study."

We applied novel between-case effect size methods to the TAII single-case research base. In addition, we used meta-analytic methodologies to examine the methodological quality of the research, calculate average effect sizes to quantify the level of evidence for TAII, and compare effect sizes across single-case and group-based experimental research. Results identified one category of TAII—computer-assisted instruction—as an evidence-based practice across both single-case and group studies.

Emerging standards for single case designs have focused attention on the need for effect sizes for summarizing and meta-analyzing findings from the designs; although many effect size measures have been proposed, there is little consensus regarding their use. This article proposes a new effect size measure for single case research that is directly comparable with the standardized mean difference (Cohen’s d) often used in between-subjects designs. Techniques are provided for estimating the new effect size, as well as its variance, from balanced or unbalanced treatment reversal designs. The proposed estimation methods are further evaluated using a simulation study and then demonstrated in two applications."

This growth expanded possibilities and inspired new questions about the contributions this methodology can make to generalizable knowledge about intervention in special education. In this paper, we discuss and extend previous standards for studies using single case designs (i.e., Horner et al., 2005). We identify new suggestions for internal validity, generality and acceptability, and reporting. We also provide considerations for single case synthesis and discuss the complexities of assessing accumulating evidence for a given practice."

In the current article, we continue this trend by applying recently developed between-case effect size measures and transparent visual analysis procedures to synthesize an up-to-date set of group contingency studies that used single-case designs. Results corroborated recent systematic reviews by indicating that group contingencies are generally effective—particularly for addressing challenging behavior in general education classrooms.

Quantitative effect size measures are often presented alongside visual analysis conclusions. Six measures across two classes—overlap measures (percentage non-overlapping data, improvement rate difference, and Tau) and parametric within-case effect sizes (standardized mean difference and log response ratio [increasing and decreasing])—were compared to determine if choice of synthesis method within and across classes impacts conclusions regarding effectiveness. The effectiveness of sensory-based interventions (SBI), a commonly used class of treatments for young children, was evaluated. Separately from evaluations of rigor and quality, authors evaluated behavior change between baseline and SBI conditions. SBI were unlikely to result in positive behavior change across all measures except IRD. However, subgroup analyses resulted in variable conclusions, indicating that the choice of measures for SCD meta-analyses can impact conclusions. Suggestions for using the log response ratio in SCD meta-analyses and considerations for understanding variability in SCD meta-analysis conclusions are discussed."

Robust variance estimation (RVE) methods provide a way to include all dependent effect sizes in a single meta-regression model, even when the nature of the dependence is unknown. RVE uses a working model of the dependence structure, but the two currently available working models are limited to each describing a single type of dependence. Drawing on flexible tools from multivariate meta-analysis, this paper describes an expanded range of working models, along with accompanying estimation methods, which offer benefits in terms of better capturing the types of data structures that occur in practice and improving the efficiency of meta-regression estimates. We describe how the methods can be implemented using existing software (the ‘metafor’ and ‘clubSandwich’ packages for R) and illustrate the approach in a meta-analysis of randomized trials examining the effects of brief alcohol interventions for adolescents and young adults."

The inclusion of such studies introduces dependence among the effect size estimates. When the number of studies is large, robust variance estimation (RVE) provides a method for pooling dependent effects, even when information on the exact dependence structure is not available. When the number of studies is small or moderate, however, test statistics and confidence intervals based on RVE can have inflated Type I error. This article describes and investigates several small-sample adjustments to F-statistics based on RVE. Simulation results demonstrate that one such test, which approximates the test statistic using Hotelling’s T-squared distribution, is level-α and uniformly more powerful than the others. An empirical application demonstrates how results based on this test compare to the large-sample F-test."

Bivariate associations between specific R/S dimensions and social health outcomes were examined in a meta-analysis using a generalized estimating equation approach. In total, 78 independent samples encompassing 14,277 patients were included in the meta-analysis. Social health was significantly associated with overall R/S (Fisher z effect size = .20; P &lt; .001) and with each of the R/S dimensions (affective R/S effect size = 0.31 [P &lt; .001]; cognitive R/S effect size = .10 [P &lt; .01]; behavioral R/S effect size = .08 [P &lt; .05]; and ‘other’ R/S effect size = .13 [P &lt; .001]). Within these dimensions, specific variables tied to socialhealth included spiritual well being, spiritual struggle, images of God, R/S beliefs, and composite R/S measures (all P values &lt; .05). None of the demographic or clinical moderating variables examined were significant. Results suggest that several R/S dimensions are modestly associated with patients’ capacity to maintain satisfying social roles and relationships in the context of cancer. Further research is needed to examine the temporal nature of these associations and the mechanisms that underlie them."

Studies investigating the correlation between R/S (eg, beliefs, experiences, coping) and mental health (eg, depression, anxiety, well being) in cancer have used very heterogeneous measures and have produced correspondingly inconsistent results. A meaningful synthesis of these findings has been lacking; thus, the objective of this review was to conduct a meta-analysis of the research on R/S and mental health. Four electronic databases were systematically reviewed, and 2073 abstracts met initial selection criteria. Reviewer pairs applied standardized coding schemes to extract indices of the correlation between R/S and mental health. In total, 617 effect sizes from 148 eligible studies were synthesized using meta-analytic generalized estimating equations, and subgroup analyses were performed to examine moderators of effects. The estimated mean correlation (Fisher z) was 0.19 (95% confidence interval [CI], 0.16-0.23), which varied as a function of R/S dimensions: affective R/S (z=0.38; 95% CI, 0.33-0.43), behavioral R/S (z=0.03; 95% CI, 20.02-0.08), cognitive R/S (z=0.10; 95% CI, 0.06-0.14), and ‘other’ R/S (z=0.08; 95% CI, 0.03-0.13). Aggregate, study-level demographic and clinical factors were not predictive of the relation between R/S and mental health. There was little indication of publication or reporting biases. The correlation between R/S and mental health generally was positive. The strength of that correlation was modest and varied as a function of the R/S dimensions and mental health domains assessed. The identification of optimal R/S measures and more sophisticated methodological approaches are needed to advance research."

Accordingly, an increasing number of psychosocial intervention studies have included SpWb as a study endpoint, and may improve SpWb even if not designed explicitly to do so. This meta‐analysis of randomized controlled trials (RCTs) evaluated effects of psychosocial interventions on SpWb in adults with cancer and tested potential moderators of intervention effects. Methods Six literature databases were systematically searched to identify RCTs of psychosocial interventions in which SpWb was an outcome. Doctoral‐level rater pairs extracted data using Covidence following Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic reviews and Meta‐Analyses guidelines. Standard meta‐analytic techniques were applied, including meta‐regression with robust variance estimation and risk‐of‐bias sensitivity analysis. Results Forty‐one RCTs were identified, encompassing 88 treatment effects among 3883 survivors. Interventions were associated with significant improvements in SpWb (\\(g = 0.22\\), 95% CI [0.14, 0.29], \\(p &lt; 0.0001\\)). Studies assessing the FACIT‐Sp demonstrated larger effect sizes than did those using other measures of SpWb (\\(g = 0.25\\), 95% CI [0.17, 0.34], vs. \\(g = 0.10\\), 95% CI [−0.02, 0.23], \\(p = 0.03\\)). No other intervention, clinical, or demographic characteristics significantly moderated effect size. Conclusions Psychosocial interventions are associated with small‐to‐medium‐sized effects on SpWb among cancer survivors. Future research should focus on conceptually coherent interventions explicitly targeting SpWb and evaluate interventions in samples that are diverse with respect to race and ethnicity, sex and cancer type."

Commonly used measures include parametric indices such as the standardized mean difference, as well as non-overlap measures such as the percentage of non-overlapping data, improvement rate difference, and non-overlap of all pairs. Currently, little is known about the properties of these indices when applied to behavioral data collected by systematic direct observation, even though systematic direct observation is the most common method for outcome measurement in single-case research. This study uses Monte Carlo simulation to investigate the properties of several widely used single-case effect size measures when applied to systematic direct observation data. Results indicate that the magnitude of the non-overlap measures and of the standardized mean difference can be strongly influenced by procedural details of the study’s design, which is a significant limitation to using these indices as effect sizes for meta-analysis of single-case designs. A less widely used parametric index, the log-response ratio, has the advantage of being insensitive to sample size and observation session length, although its magnitude is influenced by the use of partial interval recording."

Despite long-standing interest in meta-analytic synthesis of single-case research, there remains a lack of consensus about appropriate methods, even about the most basic question of what effect size metrics are useful and appropriate. I argue that operational comparability, or invariance to heterogeneous operational procedures, is crucial property for an effect size metric. I then consider two problems with operational comparability that arise in single-case research. The first problem is to find effect sizes that can be applied across studies that use different research designs, such as single-case designs and two-group randomized experiments. The second problem is to find effect sizes that can be applied across studies that use varied operations for measuring the same construct. To address each of these problems, I propose structural models that capture essential features of multiple relevant operations (either design-related operations or measurement-related operations). I then use these structural models to precisely define target effect size parameters and to consider identification issues and estimation strategies.\nChapter 1 defines operational comparability and situates the concept within the broad methodological concerns of meta-analysis, then reviews relevant features of single-case research and previously proposed effect sizes. Chapter 2 describes an abstract set of modeling criteria for constructing design-comparable effect sizes. Chapters 3 applies the general criteria to the case of standardized mean differences and proposes an effect size estimator based on restricted maximum likelihood. Chapter 4 presents several applications of the proposed models and methods. Chapter 5 proposes measurement-comparability model and defines effect size measures for use in studies of free-operant behavior, one of the most common classes of outcomes in single-case research. Chapter 6 extends the proposed effect size models to incorporate more complex features, including time trends and serial dependence, and studies a method of estimating those models through a combination of marginal quasi-likelihood and Gaussian pseudo-likelihood estimating equations. Chapter 7 collects various further extensions, areas for further research, and concluding thoughts."

The validity of a statistical method rests on whether its assumptions are plausible representations of the process by which the data were collected, yet there is evidence that some assumptions—particularly regarding normality of error distributions—may be inappropriate for single-case data. To develop more appropriate modelling assumptions and statistical methods, researchers must attend to the features of real SCD data. In this study, we examine several features of SCDs with behavioral outcome measures in order to inform development of statistical methods. Drawing on a corpus of over 300 studies, including approximately 1800 cases, from seven systematic reviews that cover a range of interventions and outcome constructs, we report the distribution of study designs, distribution of outcome measurement procedures, and features of baseline outcome data distributions for the most common types of measurements used in single-case research. We discuss implications for the development of more realistic assumptions regarding outcome distributions in SCD studies, as well as the design of Monte Carlo simulation studies evaluating the performance of statistical analysis techniques for SCED data."

    "text": "Journal Supplementary materials  Pre-Print  Code  Data\nPurpose: Speech-language pathologists (SLPs) typically examine narrative performance when completing a comprehensive language assessment. However, there is significant variability in the methodologies used to evaluate narration. The primary aims of this systematic review and meta-analysis were to a) investigate how narrative assessment type (e.g., macrostructure, microstructure, internal state language) differentiates typically developing (TD) children from children with developmental language disorder (DLD), or, TD–DLD group differences, b) identify specific narrative assessment measures (e.g., number of different words) that result in greater TD–DLD differences, and, c) evaluate participant and sample characteristics (e.g., DLD inclusionary criteria) that may uniquely influence performance differences. Method: Three electronic databases (PsychInfo, ERIC, and PubMed) and ASHAWire were searched on July 30, 2019 to locate studies that reported oral narrative language measures for both DLD and TD groups between ages 4 and 12 years; studies focusing on written narration or other developmental disorders only were excluded. Thirty-seven primary studies were identified via a three-step study selection procedure. We extracted data related to the sample participants, the narrative task(s) and assessment measures, and research design. Standardized mean differences using a bias-corrected Hedges’ \\(g\\) were the calculated effect sizes (\\(N = 382\\)). Research questions were analyzed using mixed-effects meta-regression with robust variance estimation to account for effect size dependencies. Results: Searches identified eligible studies published between 1987 and 2019. An overall meta-analysis using 382 effect sizes obtained across 37 studies showed that children with DLD had decreased narrative performance relative to TD peers, with summary estimates ranging from -0.850, 95% CI [-1.016, -0.685] to -0.794, 95% CI [-0.963, -0.624], depending on the correlation assumed. Across all models, effect size estimates showed significant heterogeneity both between and within studies, even after accounting for effect size-, sample-, and study-level predictors. Grammatical accuracy (microstructure) and story grammar (macrostructure) yielded the most consistent evidence of significant TD–DLD group differences across statistical models. Conclusions: Present findings suggest some narrative assessment measures may yield significantly different performance between children with and without DLD. However, researchers need to be consistent in their inclusionary criteria, their description of sample characteristics, and in their reporting of the correlations of measures, in order to determine which assessment measures are more likely to yield group differences."

There has been growing interest in systematic reviews and syntheses of evidence from single-case designs, but there remains a need to further develop appropriate statistical models and effect sizes for data from the designs. We propose a novel model for single-case data that exhibit non-linear time trends created by an intervention that produces gradual effects, which build up and dissipate over time. The model expresses a structural relationship between a pattern of treatment assignment and an outcome variable, making it appropriate for both treatment reversal and multiple baseline designs. It is formulated as a generalized linear model so that it can be applied to outcomes measured as frequency counts or proportions, both of which are commonly used in single-case research, while providing readily interpretable effect size estimates such as log response ratios or log odds ratios. We demonstrate the gradual effects model by applying it to data from a single-case study and examine the performance of proposed estimation methods in a Monte Carlo simulation of frequency count data."

Results indicated that studies were of high methodological quality, with nine studies identified as being methodologically sound and demonstrating positive outcomes across 14 participants.

We performed random-effects meta-analyses with robust variance estimation and assessed risk of bias with the Cochrane R.O.B. tool. Only four studies had low risk of bias in all domains, and many studies lacked standard controls such as keeping the outcome assessor and trainer unaware of the treatment condition. Following sensitivity analyses, only learning/memory robustly improved significantly more when CT was combined with NIBS compared to CT only (\\(g\\) = 0.18, 95% CI [0.07, 0.29]) at post-intervention, but not in the long-term. The effect was small and limited by substantial heterogeneity. The other seven cognitive outcome domains, symptoms, and everyday functioning did not benefit from adding NIBS to CT. Given the methodological limitation of prior studies, more high-quality trials that focus on the potential of combining NIBS and CT to enhance benefits in everyday functioning in the short- and long-term are needed to evaluate whether combining NIBS and CT is relevant for clinical practice."

This article outlines a general framework for defining effect sizes in multiple baseline designs that are directly comparable to the standardized mean difference from a between-subjects randomized experiment. The target, design-comparable effect size parameter can be estimated using restricted maximum likelihood together with a small sample correction analogous to Hedges’s g. The approach is demonstrated using hierarchical linear models that include baseline time trends and treatment-by-time interactions. A simulation compares the performance of the proposed estimator to that of an alternative, and an application illustrates the model-fitting process."

Prior work focused on developing and validating the approximations, but did not address the practice challenges encountered in applying them for purposes of planning a synthesis involving dependent effect sizes. We aim to facilitate application of these recent developments by providing practical guidance on how to conduct power analysis for planning a meta-analysis of dependent effect sizes and by introducing a new R package, POMADE, designed for this purpose. We present a comprehensive overview of resources for finding information about the study design features and model parameters needed to conduct power analysis, along with detailed worked examples using the POMADE package.

However, meta-analytic reviews of social science research often include multiple effect size estimates per primary study, leading to dependence in the estimates. Some meta-analyses also include multiple studies conducted by the same lab or investigator, creating another potential source of dependence. An increasingly popular method to handle dependence is robust variance estimation (RVE), but this method can result in inflated Type I error rates when the number of studies is small. Small-sample correction methods for RVE have been shown to control Type I error rates adequately but may be overly conservative, especially for tests of multiple-contrast hypotheses. We evaluated an alternative method for handling dependence, cluster wild bootstrapping, which has been examined in the econometrics literature but not in the context of meta-analysis. Results from two simulation studies indicate that cluster wild bootstrapping maintains adequate Type I error rates and provides more power than extant small sample correction methods, particularly for multiple-contrast hypothesis tests. We recommend using cluster wild bootstrapping to conduct hypothesis tests for meta-analyses with a small number of studies. We have also created an R package that implements such tests."

Considering potential differences related to outcomes that were targeted for intervention could help identify the most effective means of individualizing AAC interventions. Methods: We performed a systematic literature search using Academic Search Ultimate, ERIC, PsycINFO, Web of Science, and Proquest Dissertations & Theses Global to retrieve research conducted between 1978 and the beginning of 2020. Studies included in the synthesis are (a) in English; (b) has one or more participants with an intellectual delay, developmental disability(ies); (c) reported the results of an augmentative and alternative communication (AAC) intervention to supplement or replace conventional speech for people with complex communication needs; (d) was a SCED; (e) measured social-communicative outcomes. We synthesized results across studies using multi-level meta-analyses of two case-level effect size metrics, Tau and log response ratio. We conducted moderator analyses using meta-regression with robust variance estimation. Results: Across 114 included studies with 330 participants and 767 effect size, overall Tau effects were moderate, Tau = 0.72, 95% CI [0.67, 0.77], and heterogeneous. For the subset of data series where log response ratio could be estimated, the overall average effect was LRR = 1.86, 95% CI [1.58, 2.13], and effects were highly heterogeneous. There were few statistically significant differences found between moderator categories, which included communication mode, communicative function, and type of AAC implemented. Conclusions: This meta-analysis highlights the potential differences related to outcomes that were targeted for AAC interventions for individuals with ASD and IDD. AAC intervention has been shown to improve communication outcomes in this population. However, there was a lack of sufficient data to analyze for some potential moderators such as insufficient descriptive information on participant characteristics. This is likely due to the heterogeneity of the participants and implementation factors; however, these factors were frequently underreported by original study authors which disallowed systematic analysis. That said, there is a need for more detailed participant characteristic descriptions in original research reports to support future aggregation across the literature.

    "title": "Equity-related moderator analysis in syntheses of dependent effect sizes: Conceptual and statistical considerations",
    "section": "",
    "text": "Society for Research on Educational Effectiveness Conference, Arlington, VA\n Slides\n\nBackground/Context\nIn meta-analyses examining educational interventions, researchers seek to understand the distribution of intervention impacts, in order to draw generalizations about what works, for whom, and under what conditions. One common way to examine equity implications in such reviews is through moderator analysis, which involves modeling how intervention effect sizes vary depending on the characteristics of primary study participants. For example, one might estimate associations between effect size and the percentage of the primary study participants who were from a rural school, from a low-income family, identified as a specific racial or ethnic group, or designated as an English Language Learner. Such moderator analyses can provide insights about the populations and contexts where an intervention is more or less effective—that is, they can address questions of who benefits and how the effects of an educational intervention are distributed.\nMeta-analyses of educational interventions often include primary studies that report multiple relevant effect size estimates, such for more than one measure of an outcome construct, at multiple time-points, for multiple versions of an intervention, or for different sub-groups of participants. This leads to a data structure where the effects from a given study are correlated, necessitating the use of statistical methods that are appropriate for dependent observations. Methodological research in this area has provided estimation and inference methods that which can handle dependent effect sizes, including multi-level meta-analyses (Van den Noortgate et al., 2013, 2015), robust variance estimation (Hedges et al., 2010), and combinations thereof (Fernández-Castilla et al., 2020; Pustejovsky & Tipton, 2022). However, there has been much less attention to the specific forms of moderator analysis that are of interest in practice.\n\n\nPurpose/Objective/Research Question\nWe aim to identify conceptual and statistical considerations for moderator analysis of equity-related variables in meta-analyses involving dependent effect sizes. Specifically, we distinguish between direct evidence and contextual evidence about equity of impacts and show that the choice of meta-analytic model can be consequential for analyses involving direct evidence. We then examine how meta-analysts currently conduct equity-related moderator analyses, by reviewing completed research synthesis projects funded by the Institute of Education Sciences (IES) over the period of 2002 to 2018. We find that most projects do not distinguish between direct and contextual evidence and use analytic approaches that are inefficient for synthesizing direct evidence. Conceptual Considerations\nModerator analyses of equity-related variables can be carried out by regressing effect size estimates on predictors encoding participant characteristics. Consider a synthesis in which some primary studies contribute multiple effect sizes. In this data structure, a predictor might represent a study-level characteristic or one that varies across the effects within a given study. The level of variation is especially salient for analysis of equity-related variables because study-level characteristics and effect-level characteristics represent qualitatively different types of evidence. For study-level predictors, associations with effect size pertain to the study’s context and are not necessarily indicative of individual-level variation in impacts. Thus, interpretation is challenging because studies vary in many ways, with many possible sources of confounding. For effect-level predictors, within-study variation represents direct evidence about individual-level moderation (e.g., a comparison of impacts between low-income and higher-income participants in the same study), unconfounded by study-level characteristics.\nWe describe different strategies for separately investing direct and contextual evidence about moderation, including a) decomposing the predictor into study-level average and within-study centered components or b) inclusion of the raw predictor and the study-level average in a meta-regression. Although strategy (a) has been recommended previously in the context of meta-analysis of dependent effects (Tanner-Smith & Tipton, 2014), our presentation makes explicit the connection to equity-related moderator analysis and specifies the data requirements for applying it.\n\n\nStatistical Considerations\nMeta-regression with dependent effect sizes involves choosing a working model for the dependence structure, which determines the set of weights used for estimating the meta-regression. Several different working models have been proposed, including correlated effects and hierarchical effects models (Hedges et al., 2010), a correlated-and-hierarchical effects model (Pustejovsky & Tipton, 2022) and the multi-level meta-analysis model (Van den Noortgate et al., 2013, 2015). Ad hoc strategies, such as aggregating effects to the study level or ignoring dependence, can also be understood as working models.\nPrevious research and guidance about the choice of working model has argued that the choice of working model is fairly inconsequential so long as the working model is roughly similar the true dependence structure (Hedges et al., 2010; Tanner-Smith et al., 2016; Tanner-Smith & Tipton, 2014). In the appendix, we examine the exact weights assigned by a variety of different working models to studies with direct evidence and contextual evidence. Contrary to past guidance, we find that different working models can lead to quite different weighting—particularly for direct evidence (i.e., study mean-centered predictors).\n\n\nCurrent Practice\nTo understand current practices for analysis of equity-related moderator variables, we reviewed completed meta-analysis projects funded by IES over the period of 2002 to 2018. We identified grants that (a) had journal articles reporting a meta-analysis, (b) were not methodological, and (c) were not training programs. A search of the IES website for project descriptions that included the word “meta-analysis” returned 80 results, of which 25 met inclusion criteria. Table 1 summarizes the approaches to moderator analyses used in these projects. Most projects reported some form of meta-regression analysis, but very few described a centering strategy and only one project used study-mean centering. Notably, the correlated effects and hierarchical effects working models were commonly used, yet these models involve inefficient weighting of direct evidence.\n\n\nConclusions\nIn light of this review of current practice, the conceptual and statistical considerations that we describe suggest that there is substantial room for improvement in how meta-analysts conduct moderation analysis, particularly for equity-related variables where individual-level variation is of primary interest. Even under this simple—simplistic, even—conception of equity, bringing systematic review and meta-analysis methods to bear to address inequities in the education system will require not only improving analytic practices, but also changing how primary investigations frame questions, collect data, and report findings."

    "text": "Danish Center for Social Science Research, Copenhagen, Denmark\n Slides\nIn fields ranging from Education to Economics to Ecology, meta-analysts often encounter complicated data structures, in which some or all primary studies include multiple effect size estimates. These estimates may be correlated because they are based on data from a common sample or a partially overlapping sample, or may be statistically dependent due to use of common study operations. A broad analytic strategy for dealing with such data is to specify a “working model” to roughly characterize the dependence structure, then use robust inference strategies that work well even if the working model is mis-specified relative to the true data-generating process. Although the technical and computational aspects of this strategy are now well developed, questions remain about how to apply it effectively in practice. In this talk, I will examine two practical questions related to how to build models for meta-analyses involving dependent effect sizes. First, I will illustrate some connections between working models and simpler, ad hoc techniques for dealing with effect size multiplicity, arguing that these connections provide useful heuristics to guide specification of random effects structures in multi-level and multi-variate meta-analysis. Second, I will describe some analytic strategies for conducting equity-related moderator analyses, where predictors involve personal characteristics of the primary study participants that can vary both within and between studies. I distinguish between direct evidence and contextual evidence about equity of impacts and show that the choice of working model can be consequential for analyses involving direct evidence. Throughout, I will highlight some open issues and practical challenges involved in modeling dependent effect sizes."

Specifically, we examined participant characteristics in group-design studies reporting AAC intervention outcomes and how these compared to those reported in single-case experimental designs (SCEDs). In addition, we compared the status of intervention features reported in group and SCED studies with respect to instructional strategies utilized. Participants: Participants included school-aged individuals with CCNs who also experienced ASD or ASD with an intellectual delay who utilized aided or unaided AAC. Method: A systematic review using descriptive statistics and effect sizes was implemented. Results: Findings revealed that participant features such as race, ethnicity, and home language continue to be underreported in both SCED and group-design studies. Participants in SCED investigations more frequently used multiple communication modes when compared to participants in group studies. The status of pivotal skills such as imitation was sparsely reported in both types of studies. With respect to instructional features, group-design studies were more apt to utilize clinical rather than educational or home settings when compared with SCED studies. In addition, SCED studies were more apt to utilize instructional methods that closely adhered to instructional features more typically characterized as being associated with behavioral approaches. Conclusion: The authors discuss future research needs, practice implications, and a more detailed specification of treatment intensity parameters for future research."

Investigators identified 117 primary studies that implemented AAC interventions with school-aged individuals (up to 22 years) with autism spectrum disorder and/or intellectual disability associated with complex communication needs and assessed social-communication outcomes. All included studies involved single-case experimental designs and met basic study design quality standards. We synthesized findings across studies using two complementary effect size indices, Tau(AB) and the log response ratio, and multi-level meta-analysis with robust variance estimation. With Tau(AB), the overall average effect across 338 participants was 0.72, 95% CI [0.67, 0.76], with a high degree of heterogeneity across studies. With the log response ratio, the overall average effect corresponded to a 538% increase from baseline levels of responding, 95% CI [388%, 733%], with a high degree of heterogeneity across studies and contrasts. Moderator analyses detected few differences in effectiveness when comparing across diagnoses, ages, the number and type of communication modes the participants used prior to intervention, the number of words used by the participants prior to intervention, and imitation use prior to intervention."

This paper describes the alternating renewal process model in its general form, demonstrates how it provides an organizing framework for most past simulation research on direct observation procedures, and introduces a freely available software package that implements the model. The software can be used to simulate behavior streams as well as data from many common recording procedures, including continuous recording, momentary time sampling, event counting, and interval recording procedures. Several examples illustrate how the software can be used to study the validity and reliability of direct observation data and to develop measurement strategies during the planning phases of empirical studies."

    "section": "",
    "text": "Journal Supplementary materials  Pre-Print\nCross-classified random effects modeling (CCREM) is a common approach for analyzing cross-classified data in education. However, when the focus of a study is on the regression coefficients at level one rather than on the random effects, ordinary least squares regression with cluster robust variance estimators (OLS-CRVE) or fixed effects regression with CRVE (FE-CRVE) could be appropriate approaches. These alternative methods may be advantageous because they rely on weaker assumptions than what is required by CCREM. We conducted a Monte Carlo Simulation study to compare the performance of CCREM, OLS-CRVE, and FE-CRVE in models with crossed random effects, including conditions where homoscedasticity assumptions and exogeneity assumptions held and conditions where they were violated. We found that CCREM performed the best when its assumptions are all met. However, when homoscedasticity assumptions are violated, OLS-CRVE and FE-CRVE provided similar or better performance than CCREM. FE-CRVE showed the best performance when the exogeneity assumption is violated. Thus, we recommend two-way FE-CRVE as a good alternative to CCREM, particularly if the homoscedasticity or exogeneity assumptions of the CCREM might be in doubt."

This paper reports an investigation by four coordinated laboratories of the prospective replicability of 16 novel experimental findings using current optimal practices: high statistical power, preregistration, and complete methodological transparency. In contrast to past systematic replication efforts that reported replication rates averaging 50%, replication attempts here produced the expected effects with significance testing (p&lt;.05) in 86% of attempts, slightly exceeding maximum expected replicability based on observed effect size and sample size. When one lab attempted to replicate an effect discovered by another lab, the effect size in the replications was 97% that of the original study. This high replication rate justifies confidence in rigor enhancing methods and suggests that past failures to replicate may be attributable to departures from optimal procedures."

Measurements collected using partial interval recording suffer from construct invalidity because they are not readily interpretable in terms of the underlying characteristics of the behavior. Using an alternating renewal process model for the behavior under observation, we demonstrate that ignoring the construct invalidity of PIR data can produce misleading inferences, such as inferring that an intervention reduces the prevalence of an undesirable behavior when in fact it has the opposite effect. We then propose four different methods for analyzing PIR summary measurements, each of which can be used to draw inferences about interpretable behavioral parameters. We demonstrate the methods by applying them to data from two single-case studies of problem behavior."

Self-efficacy expectancies, estimates of confidence to execute behaviors, are important in that changes in selfefficacy expectations are positively related to future behaviors that promote health and wellbeing. The current meta-analysis investigated the impact of psychological interventions on self-efficacy expectations for a variety of health behaviors among cancer patients. Methods: Ovid Medline, PsycINFO, CINAHL, EMBASE, Cochrane Library, and Web of Science were searched with specific search terms for identifying randomized controlled trials (RCTs) that focused on psychologically-based interventions. Included studies had: 1) an adult cancer sample, 2) a self-efficacy expectation measure of specific behaviors and 3) an RCT design. Standard screening and reliability procedures were used for selecting and coding studies. Coding included theoretically informed moderator variables. Results: Across 79 RCTs, 223 effect sizes, and 8678 participants, the weighted average effect of self-efficacy expectations was estimated as g=0.274 (p&lt;.001). Consistent with Self-Efficacy Theory, the average effect for in-person intervention delivery (g=0.329) was significantly greater than for all other formats (g=0.154, p=.023; e.g., audiovisual, print, telephone, web/internet). Conclusions: The results establish the impact of psychological interventions on self-efficacy expectations as comparable in effect size to commonly reported outcomes (distress, fatigue, pain). Additionally, the result that in-person interventions achieved the largest effect is supported by Social Learning Theory and could inform research related to the development and evaluation of interventions."

Much of single-case research focuses on behavioral outcomes in free-operant contexts, which may be measured using a variety of different direct observation procedures. This article describes a suite of effect sizes for quantifying changes in free-operant behavior, motivated by an alternating renewal process model that allows measurement comparability to be established in precise terms. These effect size metrics have the advantage of comporting with how direct observation data are actually collected and summarized. Effect size estimators are proposed that are applicable when the behavior being measured remains stable within a given treatment condition. The methods are illustrated by 2 examples, including a re-analysis of a systematic review of the effects of choice-making opportunities on problem behavior."

The primary objective of this meta-analysis was to determine whether psychosocial interventions increase positive affect in cancer survivors. Methods We coded 28 randomized controlled trials of psychosocial interventions assessing 2082 cancer survivors from six electronic databases. We calculated 76 effect sizes for positive affect and conducted synthesis using random effects models with robust variance estimation. Tests for moderation included demographic, clinical, and intervention characteristics. Results Interventions had a modest effect on positive affect (g = 0.35, 95% CI [0.16, 0.54]) with substantial heterogeneity of effects across studies (\\(\\hat\\tau^2\\) = 0.40; \\(I^2\\) = 78%). Three significant moderators were identified: in-person interventions outperformed remote interventions (P = .046), effects were larger when evaluated against standard of care or wait list control conditions versus attentional, educational, or component controls (P = .009), and trials with survivors of early-stage cancer diagnoses yielded larger effects than those with advanced-stage diagnoses (P = .046). We did not detect differential benefits of psychosocial interventions across samples varying in sex, age, on-treatment versus off-treatment status, or cancer type. Although no conclusive evidence suggested outcome reporting biases (P = .370), effects were smaller in studies with lower risk of bias. Conclusions In-person interventions with survivors of early-stage cancers hold promise for enhancing positive affect, but more methodological rigor is needed. Implications for Cancer Survivors Positive affect strategies can be an explicit target in evidence-based medicine and have a role in patient-centered survivorship care, providing tools to uniquely mobilize human strengths."

Because meaning and purpose are often threatened by a cancer diagnosis and treatment, interventions have been developed to promote meaning and purpose. The present meta-analysis of randomized controlled trials (RCTs) evaluated effects of psychosocial interventions on meaning/purpose in adults with cancer and tested potential moderators of intervention effects. Six literature databases were systematically searched to identify RCTs of psychosocial interventions in which meaning or purpose was an outcome. Using Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta‐Analyses guidelines, rater pairs extracted and evaluated data for quality. Findings were synthesized across studies with standard meta‐analytic methods, including meta‐regression with robust variance estimation and risk-of-bias sensitivity analysis. Twenty-nine RCTs were identified, and they encompassed 82 treatment effects among 2305 patients/survivors. Psychosocial interventions were associated with significant improvements in meaning/purpose (g = 0.37; 95% CI, 0.22-0.52; P &lt; .0001). Interventions designed to enhance meaning/purpose (g = 0.42; 95% CI, 0.24-0.60) demonstrated significantly higher effect sizes than those targeting other primary outcomes (g = 0.18; 95% CI, 0.09-0.27; P = .009). Few other intervention, clinical, or demographic characteristics tested were significant moderators. In conclusion, the results suggest that psychosocial interventions are associated with small to medium effects in enhancing meaning/purpose among patients with cancer, and the benefits are comparable to those of interventions designed to reduce depression, pain, and fatigue in patients with cancer. Methodological concerns include small samples and ambiguity regarding allocation concealment. Future research should focus on explicitly meaning-centered interventions and identify optimal treatment or survivorship phases for implementation."

In an effort to synthesize previous findings, a meta-analysis of the relation between R/S and patient-reported physical health in cancer patients was performed. A search of PubMed, PsycINFO, the Cumulative Index to Nursing and Allied Health Literature, and the Cochrane Library yielded 2073 abstracts, which were independently evaluated by pairs of raters. The meta-analysis was conducted for 497 effect sizes from 101 unique samples encompassing more than 32,000 adult cancer patients. R/S measures were categorized into affective, behavioral, cognitive, and ‘other’ dimensions. Physical health measures were categorized into physical well-being, functional well-being, and physical symptoms. Average estimated correlations (Fisher z scores) were calculated with generalized estimating equations with robust variance estimation. Overall R/S was associated with overall physical health (z=0.153, P&lt;.001); this relation was not moderated by sociodemographic or clinical variables. Affective R/S was associated with physical well-being (z=0.167, P&lt;.001), functional well-being (z=0.343, P&lt;.001), and physical symptoms (z=0.282, P&lt;.001).

With many of these criteria, making judgments about stability could yield data with limited variability, which may have consequences for statistical inference and effect size estimates. However, little research has examined the impact of response-guided design on the resulting data. Drawing on both applied and methodological research, we describe several algorithms as models for response-guided design. We use simulation methods to assess how using a response-guided design impacts the baseline data pattern. The simulations generate baseline data in the form of frequency counts, a common type of outcome in SCEDs. Most of the response-guided algorithms we identified lead to baselines with approximately unbiased mean levels, but nearly all of them lead to underestimates in the baseline variance. We discuss implications for the use of response-guided designs in practice and for the plausibility of specific algorithms as representations of actual research practice."

Although asymptotically consistent, CRVE can be biased downward when the number of clusters is small, leading to hypothesis tests with rejection rates that are too high. More accurate tests can be constructed using bias-reduced linearization (BRL), which corrects the CRVE based on a working model, in conjunction with a Satterthwaite approximation for t-tests. We propose a generalization of BRL that can be applied in models with arbitrary sets of fixed effects, where the original BRL method is undefined, and describe how to apply the method when the regression is estimated after absorbing the fixed effects. We also propose a small-sample test for multiple-parameter hypotheses, which generalizes the Satterthwaite approximation for t-tests. In simulations covering a wide range of scenarios, we find that the conventional cluster-robust Wald test can severely over-reject while the proposed small-sample test maintains Type I error close to nominal levels.

In research areas where SCEDs are prevalent, there is a need for methods to synthesize results across multiple studies. One approach to synthesis uses a multi-level meta-analysis (MLMA) model to describe the distribution of effect sizes across studies and across cases within studies. However, MLMA relies on having accurate sampling variances of effect size estimates for each case, which may not be possible due to auto-correlation in the raw data series. One possible solution is to combine MLMA with robust variance estimation (RVE), which provides valid assessments of uncertainty even if the sampling variances of effect size estimates are inaccurate. Another possible solution is to forgo MLMA and use simpler, ordinary least squares (OLS) methods with RVE. This study evaluates the performance of effect size estimators and methods of synthesizing SCEDs in the presence of auto-correlation, for several different effect size metrics, via a Monte Carlo simulation designed to emulate the features of real data series. Results demonstrate that the MLMA model with RVE performs properly in terms of bias, accuracy, and confidence interval coverage for estimating overall average log response ratios.

Two methodological challenges when conducting meta-analysis include selective reporting and correlated dependent effect sizes. Selective reporting is often a result of selective publication practices based on the statistical significance of study findings, which threatens the validity of meta-analytic results. One of the main sources of dependent effect sizes is the inclusion of multiple outcome measures from a primary study. This violates conventional, univariate meta-analytic techniques. Meta-analysts lack validated methods to detect the presence of selective reporting while incorporating methods to handle dependent effect sizes. This study evaluates currently available univariate selective reporting methods, when ignoring dependence, selecting one effect size per study, or aggregating dependent correlated effect sizes. This study also proposes and examines an Egger’s Regression variant incorporated with Robust Variance Estimation (RVE) to handle within-study dependence. A Monte Carlo simulation study assess the performance of the methods for Type I error rates in the absence of selective reporting, and power to detect selective reporting when introduced. Ignoring dependence inflates Type I error rates for all univariate detection methods. Type I error rates are maintained with regression tests when dependent effect sizes are sampled, aggregated or modeled using RVE.

We examine the effects of TCMC on students’ progress into post-secondary education by comparing students who participated in TCMC during the 2016-17 school year (the first year of implementation) to observationally similar students, either from a previous cohort that did not have access to TCMC or from the same cohort but who did not enroll in the course. We find that, although students who took TCMC graduated at slightly higher rates than comparison students, they had lower rates of enrollment in post-secondary education, driven by lower rates of enrollment in 4-year colleges or universities. Enrollment gradually became more similar over the four semesters following graduation from high school. We find that students who took TCMC were also less likely than students in the comparison group to pass college-level and developmental math courses. Longer-term cumulative outcomes showed stronger reductions in rates of math course passage. However, these results must be interpreted cautiously because we were unable to fully assess and account for students’ college-readiness status at the start of their senior year."

In response to House Bill 5 requirements, the Charles A. Dana Center developed a model college preparatory mathematics course, Transition to College Mathematics Course (TCMC), which has been adopted by dozens of school districts across Texas over the past several school years. In prior work, we examined the effects of TCMC on students’ progress into post-secondary education by comparing two student cohorts who participated in TCMC to observationally similar students from the same cohort but who did not enroll in the course. In this report, we investigate the extent of heterogeneity in the effects of participating in TCMC. We find little evidence that the program was differentially effective for students from different socio-economic backgrounds, nor do we find evidence that program effects varied by the number of years that it had been offered. However, for key outcomes such as rates of passing a college-level math course, the effects of participating in TCMC may have varied across the schools that offered the course. Just as in prior work, these findings must be interpreted cautiously because we were unable to fully assess and account for students’ college-readiness status at the start of their senior year."

    "text": "A while back, I posted the outline of a problem about the number of significant effect size estimates in a study that reports multiple outcomes. This problem interests me because it connects to the issue of selective reporting of study results, which creates problems for meta-analysis. Here, I’ll re-state the problem in slightly more general terms and then make some notes about what’s going on.\nConsider a study that assesses some effect size across \\(m\\) different outcomes. (We’ll be thinking about one study at a time here, so no need to index the study as we would in a meta-analysis problem.) Let \\(T_i\\) denote the effect size estimate for outcome \\(i\\), let \\(V_i\\) denote the sampling variance of the effect size estimate for outcome \\(i\\), and let \\(\\theta_i\\) denote the true effect size parameter for corresponding to outcome \\(i\\). Assume that the study outcomes \\(\\left[T_i\\right]_{i=1}^m\\) follow a correlated-and-hierarchical effects model, in which \\[T_i = \\mu + u + v_i + e_i,\\] where the study-level error \\(u \\sim N\\left(0,\\tau^2\\right)\\), the effect-specific error \\(v_i \\stackrel{iid}{\\sim} N\\left(0, \\omega^2\\right)\\), and the vector of sampling errors \\(\\left[e_i\\right]_{i=1}^m\\) is multivariate normal with mean \\(\\mathbf{0}\\), known variances \\(\\text{Var}(e_i) = \\sigma^2\\), and compound symmetric correlation structure \\(\\text{cor}(e_h, e_i) = \\rho\\).\nDefine \\(A_i\\) as an indicator that is equal to one if \\(T_i\\) is statistically significant at level \\(\\alpha\\) based on a one-sided test, and otherwise equal to zero. (Equivalently, let \\(A_i\\) be equal to one if the effect is statistically significant at level \\(2 \\alpha\\) and in the theoretically expected direction.) Formally, \\[A_i = I\\left(\\frac{T_i}{\\sigma} &gt; q_\\alpha \\right)\\] where \\(q_\\alpha = \\Phi^{-1}(1 - \\alpha)\\) is the critical value from a standard normal distribution (e.g., \\(q_{.05} = 1.645\\), \\(q_{.025} = 1.96\\)). Let \\(N_A = \\sum_{i=1}^m A_i\\) denote the total number of statistically significant effect sizes in the study. The question is: what is the distribution of \\(N_A\\)."

    "text": "Compound symmetry to the rescue\nAs I noted in the previous post, this set-up means that the effect size estimates have a compound symmetric distribution. We can make this a bit more explicit by writing the sampling errors in terms of the sum of a component that’s common acrosss outcomes and a component that’s specific to each outcome. Thus, let \\(e_i = f + g_i\\), where \\(f \\sim N\\left(0, \\rho \\sigma^2 \\right)\\) and \\(g_i \\stackrel{iid}{\\sim} N \\left(0, (1 - \\rho) \\sigma^2\\right)\\). Let me also define \\(\\zeta = \\mu + u + f\\) as the conditional mean of the effects. It then follows that the effect size estimates are conditionally independent, given the common components: \\[\n\\left(T_i | \\zeta \\right) \\stackrel{iid}{\\sim} N\\left(\\zeta, \\omega^2 + (1 - \\rho) \\sigma^2\\right)\n\\] Furthermore, the conditional probability of a significant effect is \\[\n\\text{Pr}(A_i = 1 | \\zeta) = \\Phi\\left(\\frac{\\zeta - q_{\\alpha} \\sigma}{\\sqrt{\\omega^2 + (1 - \\rho)\\sigma^2}}\\right)\n\\] and \\(A_1,...,A_m\\) are mutually independent, conditional on \\(\\zeta\\). Therefore, the conditional distribution of \\(N_A\\) is binomial, \\[\n\\left(N_A | \\zeta\\right) \\sim Bin(m, \\pi)\n\\] where \\[\n\\pi = \\Phi\\left(\\frac{\\zeta - q_{\\alpha} \\sigma}{\\sqrt{\\omega^2 + (1 - \\rho)\\sigma^2}}\\right).\n\\] What about the unconditional distribution?\nTo get rid of the \\(\\zeta\\), we need to integrate over its distribution, which leads to \\[\n\\text{Pr}(N_A = a) = \\text{E}\\left[\\text{Pr}\\left(N_A | \\zeta\\right)\\right] = \\int f_{N_A}\\left(a | \\zeta, \\omega, \\sigma, \\rho, m\\right) \\times f_\\zeta(\\zeta | \\mu, \\tau, \\sigma, \\rho) \\ d \\zeta,\n\\] where \\(f_{N_A}\\left(a | \\zeta, \\omega, \\sigma, \\rho \\right)\\) is a binomial density with size \\(m\\) and probability \\(\\pi = \\pi(\\zeta, \\omega, \\sigma, \\rho)\\) and \\(f_\\zeta(\\zeta | \\mu, \\tau, \\sigma, \\rho)\\) is a normal density with mean \\(\\mu\\) and variance \\(\\tau^2 + \\rho \\sigma^2\\).\nThis distribution is what you might call a binomial-normal convolution or a random-intercept probit model (where the random intercept is \\(\\zeta\\)). As far as I know, the distribution cannot be evaluated analytically but instead must be calculated using some sort of numerical integration routine.

    "text": "Just the moments, please\nIf all we care about is the expectation of \\(N_A\\), we don’t need to bother with all the conditioning business and can just look at the marginal distribution of the effect size estimates taken individually. Marginally, \\(T_i\\) is normally distributed with mean \\(\\mu\\) and variance \\(\\tau^2 + \\omega^2 + \\sigma^2\\), so \\(\\text{Pr}(A_i = 1) = \\psi\\), where \\[\n\\psi = \\Phi\\left(\\frac{\\mu - q_{\\alpha} \\sigma}{\\sqrt{\\tau^2 + \\omega^2 + \\sigma^2}}\\right).\n\\] By the linearity of expectations, \\[\n\\text{E}(N_A) = \\sum_{i=1}^m \\text{E}(A_i) = m \\psi.\n\\]\nWe can also get an approximation for the variance of \\(N_A\\) by working with its conditional distribution above. By the rule of variance decomposition, \\[\n\\begin{aligned}\n\\text{Var}(N_A) &= \\text{E}\\left[\\text{Var}\\left(N_A | \\zeta\\right)\\right] + \\text{Var}\\left[\\text{E}\\left(N_A | \\zeta\\right)\\right] \\\\\n&= m \\times \\text{E}\\left[\\pi (1 - \\pi)\\right] + m^2 \\times \\text{Var}\\left[\\pi\\right]\\\\\n&= m \\times \\text{E}\\left[\\pi\\right] \\left(1 - \\text{E}\\left[\\pi\\right]\\right) + m (m - 1) \\times \\text{Var}\\left[\\pi\\right],\n\\end{aligned}\n\\] where \\(\\pi\\) is, as defined above, a function of \\(\\zeta\\) and thus a random variable.

On the other hand, if the amount of independent variation in the effect sizes is small, so \\(\\omega^2\\) is near zero and \\(\\rho\\) is near 1, then the term on the right will approach \\(m(m - 1)\\psi(1 - \\psi)\\) and \\(\\text{Var}\\left(N_A\\right)\\) will approach \\(m^2 \\psi(1 - \\psi)\\), or the variance of \\(m\\) times a single Bernoulli variate.

    "section": "",
    "text": "In Tipton and Pustejovsky (2015), we examined several different small-sample approximations for cluster-robust Wald test statistics, which are like \\(F\\) statistics but based on cluster-robust variance estimators. These statistics are, frankly, kind of weird and awkward to work with, and the approximations that we examined were far from perfect. In this post, I will look in detail at the robust Wald statistic for a simple but common scenario: a one-way ANOVA problem with clusters of dependent observations. \\(\\def\\Pr{{\\text{Pr}}}\n\\def\\E{{\\text{E}}}\n\\def\\Var{{\\text{Var}}}\n\\def\\Cov{{\\text{Cov}}}\n\\def\\cor{{\\text{cor}}}\n\\def\\bm{\\mathbf}\n\\def\\bs{\\boldsymbol}\\)\nConsider a setup where clusters can be classified into one of \\(C\\) categories, with each cluster of observations falling into a single category. Let \\(\\bs\\mu = \\left[\\mu_c \\right]_{c=1}^C\\) denote the means of these categories. Suppose we have an estimator of those means \\(\\bs{\\hat\\mu} = \\left[\\hat\\mu_c\\right]_{c=1}^C\\) and a corresponding cluster-robust variance estimator \\(\\bm{V}^R = \\bigoplus_{c=1}^C V^R_c\\). Note that \\(\\bm{V}^R\\) is diagonal because the estimators for each category are independent. Assume that the robust variance estimator is unbiased so \\(\\E\\left(V^R_c\\right) = \\Var\\left( \\hat\\mu_c \\right) = \\psi_c\\) for \\(c = 1,...,C\\). Let \\(\\bs\\Psi = \\bigoplus_{c=1}^C \\psi_c\\).\nSuppose that we want to test the null hypothesis that that means of the categories are all equal, \\(H_0: \\mu_1 = \\mu_2 = \\cdots = \\mu_C\\). We can express this null using a \\(q \\times C\\) contrast matrix \\(\\bm{C} = \\left[-\\bm{1}_q \\ \\bm{I}_q \\right]\\), where \\(q = C - 1\\). The null hypothesis is then \\(\\bm{C} \\bs\\mu = \\bm{0}_q\\). The corresponding cluster-robust Wald statistic is \\[\nQ = \\bs{\\hat\\mu}' \\bm{C}' \\left(\\bm{C} \\bm{V}^R \\bm{C}'\\right)^{-1} \\bm{C} \\bs{\\hat\\mu}.\n\\] Under the null hypothesis, the distribution of \\(Q\\) will converge to a \\(\\chi^2_q\\) as the number of clusters in each category grows large. However, with a limited number of clusters in some of the categories, this approximate reference distribution is not very accurate and tests based on it can have wildly inflated type I error rates.\nIn the paper, we considered several different ways of approximating the distribution of \\(Q\\) that work at smaller sample sizes. One class of approaches to approximating the sampling distribution of \\(Q\\) is to use a Hotelling’s \\(T^2\\) distribution with degrees of freedom \\(\\eta\\). Given the degrees of freedom, Hotelling’s \\(T^2\\) is a multiple of an \\(F\\) distribution: \\[\n\\frac{\\eta - q + 1}{\\eta q} Q \\sim F(q, \\eta - q + 1).\n\\] The question is then how to determine \\(\\eta\\).\nSeveral of the approaches that we considered are based on representing the \\(Q\\) statistic as \\[\nQ = \\bm{z}' \\bm{D}^{-1} \\bm{z},\n\\] where \\(\\bs\\Omega = \\bm{C} \\bs\\Psi \\bm{C}'\\), \\(\\bm{z} = \\bs\\Omega^{-1/2}\\bm{C}\\hat\\mu_c\\), \\(\\bm{G} = \\bs\\Omega^{-1/2} \\bm{C}\\), and \\[\n\\bm{D} = \\bm{G} \\bm{V}^R \\bm{G}'.\n\\] The various approaches we considered involve different ways of approximating the sampling distribution of \\(\\bm{D}\\).\nOne of the approximations involves finding degrees of freedom \\(\\eta\\) by following a strategy suggested by Zhang (2012, 2013). These degrees of freedom are given by \\[\n\\eta_Z = \\frac{q(q + 1)}{\\sum_{s=1}^q \\sum_{t = 1}^q \\Var(d_{st})},\n\\] where \\(d_{st}\\) is the entry in row \\(s\\), column \\(t\\) of \\(\\bm{D}\\). To find \\(\\eta_Z\\), we can compute the denominator using general formulas given in the paper. However, with a bit of analysis we can find a much simpler expression for the special case of one-way ANOVA.\nBefore going further, it’s useful to observe that \\(\\bm{D}\\) is invariant to linear transformations of \\(\\bm{C}\\). In particular, an equivalent way to write the null hypothesis is as \\(H_0: \\bs\\Psi_{\\circ}^{-1/2} \\bm{C} = \\bm{0}_q\\), where \\(\\bs\\Psi_{\\circ} = \\bigoplus_{c=2}^C \\psi_c\\) is the diagonal of the true sampling variances of categories 2 through \\(C\\), omitting the first category. Thus, let me redefine \\[\n\\bs\\Omega = \\bs\\Psi_{\\circ}^{-1/2} \\bm{C} \\bs\\Psi \\bm{C}'\\bs\\Psi_{\\circ}^{-1/2},\n\\] \\(\\bm{z} = \\bs\\Omega^{-1/2}\\bs\\Psi_{\\circ}^{-1/2}\\bm{C}\\hat\\mu_c\\), and \\[\n\\bm{G} = \\bs\\Omega^{-1/2} \\bs\\Psi_{\\circ}^{-1/2} \\bm{C}.\n\\] This transformation of the constraint matrix will make it possible to find a closed-form expression for \\(\\bs\\Omega^{-1/2}\\).\nNow, observe that \\[\n\\begin{aligned}\n\\bs\\Omega &= \\bs\\Psi_{\\circ}^{-1/2} \\bm{C} \\bs\\Psi \\bm{C}'\\bs\\Psi_{\\circ}^{-1/2} \\\\\n&= \\bs\\Psi_{\\circ}^{-1/2} \\left(\\bs\\Psi_{\\circ} + \\psi_1 \\bm{1}_q \\bm{1}_q'\\right)\\bs\\Psi_{\\circ}^{-1/2} \\\\\n&= \\bm{I}_q + \\psi_1 \\bm{f} \\bm{f}',\n\\end{aligned}\n\\] where \\(\\bm{f} = \\bs\\Psi_{\\circ}^{-1/2} \\bm{1}_q = \\left[ \\psi_c^{-1/2}\\right]_{c = 2}^C\\). From the Woodbury identity, \\[\n\\bs\\Omega^{-1} = \\bm{I} - \\frac{1}{W} \\bm{f} \\bm{f}',\n\\] where \\(W = \\sum_{c=1}^C \\frac{1}{\\psi_c}\\).\nFasi, Higham, and Liu (2023) provide formulas for \\(p^{th}\\) roots of low-rank updates to scaled identity matrices. Their results provide a neat closed-form expression for \\(\\bs\\Omega^{-1/2}\\). From their Equation (1.9), \\[\n\\bs\\Omega^{-1/2} = \\mathbf{I}_q - \\kappa \\ \\bm{f} \\bm{f}',\n\\] where \\(\\kappa = \\frac{\\sqrt{\\psi_1}}{W \\sqrt{\\psi_1} + \\sqrt{W}}\\). Further, we can write the \\(q \\times C\\) matrix \\(\\bm{G}\\) as \\[\n\\begin{aligned}\n\\bm{G} &= \\bs\\Omega^{-1/2} \\bs\\Psi_{\\circ}^{-1/2} \\bm{C} \\\\\n&= \\left( \\mathbf{I}_q - \\kappa \\ \\bm{f} \\bm{f}' \\right) \\bs\\Psi_{\\circ}^{-1/2} \\left[-\\bm{1}_q, \\ \\bm{I}_q \\right] \\\\\n&= \\left[\\frac{\\kappa(W \\psi_1 - 1) - \\psi_1}{\\psi_1} \\bm{f},  \\left( \\mathbf{I}_q - \\kappa \\ \\bm{f} \\bm{f}' \\right) \\bs\\Psi_{\\circ}^{-1/2}\\right],\n\\end{aligned}\n\\] with entries given by \\[\ng_{sc} = \\begin{cases}\n\\frac{\\kappa(W \\psi_1 - 1) - \\psi_1}{\\psi_1 \\sqrt{\\psi_{s+1}}} & \\text{if} \\quad c = 1 \\\\\n\\frac{I(s+1 = c)}{\\sqrt{\\psi_{c}}} - \\frac{\\kappa}{\\psi_c \\sqrt{\\psi_{s+1}}} & \\text{if} \\quad c &gt; 1.\n\\end{cases}\n\\] Because \\(\\bm{D} = \\bm{G} \\bm{V}^R \\bm{G}'\\) and \\(\\bm{V}^R\\) is diagonal, we can write the entries of \\(\\bm{D}\\) as \\[\nd_{st} = \\sum_{c=1}^C g_{sc} g_{tc} V^R_c.\n\\] And because the variance estimators for each category are independent, \\[\n\\Var(d_{st}) = \\sum_{c=1}^C g_{sc}^2 g_{tc}^2 \\Var(V^R_c).\n\\] In prior work, we derived expressions for the Satterthwaite degrees of freedom for variances of average effect sizes, and the same formulas can be applied here with the category-specific \\(V^R_c\\). Let me write \\(\\nu_c = 2\\left[\\E(V^R_c)\\right]^2 / \\Var(V^R_c)\\) for the degrees of freedom corresponding to category \\(c\\). Then \\[\n\\Var(d_{st}) = 2 \\sum_{c=1}^C g_{sc}^2 g_{tc}^2 \\frac{\\psi_c^2}{\\nu_c}.\n\\] We can use this to obtain an expression for Zhang’s approximate degrees of freedom: \\[\n\\begin{aligned}\nq(q + 1)\\eta_Z^{-1} &= \\sum_{s=1}^q \\sum_{t = 1}^q \\Var(d_{st}) \\\\\n&= 2\\sum_{s=1}^q \\sum_{t = 1}^q \\sum_{c=1}^C g_{sc}^2 g_{tc}^2 \\frac{\\psi_c^2}{\\nu_c} \\\\\n&= 2\\sum_{c=1}^C \\frac{\\psi_c^2}{\\nu_c} \\left(\\sum_{s=1}^q g_{sc}^2\\right)^2.\n\\end{aligned}\n\\] Now, all we need to do is simplify… \\[\n\\begin{aligned}\n\\sum_{s=1}^q g_{s1}^2 &= \\sum_{s=1}^q \\frac{\\left(\\kappa(W \\psi_1 - 1) - \\psi_1\\right)^2}{\\psi_1^2 \\psi_{s+1}} \\\\\n&= \\frac{\\left(\\kappa(W \\psi_1 - 1) - \\psi_1\\right)^2}{\\psi_1^2} \\sum_{c=2}^C \\frac{1}{\\psi_{s+1}} \\\\\n&= \\frac{\\left(\\kappa(W \\psi_1 - 1) - \\psi_1\\right)^2}{\\psi_1^2} \\frac{(W \\psi_1 - 1)}{\\psi_1} \\\\\n&= \\text{...a bunch of tedious algebra...} \\\\\n&= \\frac{1}{\\psi_1^2} \\left(\\psi_1 - \\frac{1}{W}\\right)\n\\end{aligned}\n\\] and, for \\(c = 2,...,C\\), \\[\n\\begin{aligned}\n\\sum_{s=1}^q g_{sc}^2 &= \\sum_{s=1}^q \\left(\\frac{I(s+1 = c)}{\\sqrt{\\psi_{c}}} - \\frac{\\kappa}{\\psi_c \\sqrt{\\psi_{s+1}}}\\right)^2 \\\\\n&= \\frac{1}{\\psi_c} - \\frac{2 \\kappa}{\\psi_c^2} + \\frac{\\kappa^2}{\\psi_c^2}\\sum_{s=1}^q \\frac{1}{\\psi_{s+1}} \\\\\n&= \\frac{1}{\\psi_c} - \\frac{2 \\kappa}{\\psi_c^2} + \\frac{\\kappa^2}{\\psi_c^2}\\frac{(W \\psi_1 - 1)}{\\psi_1} \\\\\n&= \\text{...a bunch of tedious algebra...} \\\\\n&= \\frac{1}{\\psi_c^2} \\left(\\psi_c - \\frac{1}{W}\\right)\n\\end{aligned}\n\\] Thus, \\[\n\\begin{aligned}\nq(q + 1)\\eta_Z^{-1} &= 2\\sum_{c=1}^C \\frac{\\psi_c^2}{\\nu_c} \\left(\\sum_{s=1}^q g_{sc}^2\\right)^2 \\\\\n&= 2\\sum_{c=1}^C \\frac{1}{\\nu_c \\psi_c^2}\\left(\\psi_c - \\frac{1}{W}\\right)^2 \\\\\n&= 2\\sum_{c=1}^C \\frac{1}{\\nu_c}\\left(1 - \\frac{1}{\\psi_c W}\\right)^2\n\\end{aligned}\n\\] or, rearranging, \\[\n\\eta_Z = \\frac{C(C - 1)}{2 \\sum_{c=1}^C \\frac{1}{\\nu_c}\\left(1 - \\frac{1}{\\psi_c W}\\right)^2}.\n\\] It’s a surprisingly clean formula! Once these degrees of freedom are calculated, the degrees of freedom for the reference \\(F\\) distribution would be \\(q\\) and \\(\\eta_Z - q + 1\\).\nIn the paper, we also considered two other degrees of freedom approximations, which involve not only the variances of \\(d_{st}\\) but also the covariances between entries. In principle, one could follow similar algebra to get expressions for these other degrees of freedom as well. However, our simulations indicated that the other degrees of freedom approximations tend to be overly conservative and produce type-I error rates way below the nominal level (essentially, hardly ever rejecting the null) and less accurate than HTZ. So, there’s not much reason to work through them unless you find algebra enjoyable for its own sake.\nA further question about this cluster-robust Wald statistic is how to approximate its sampling distribution under specific alternative hypotheses. In other words, given a vector of means \\(\\mu_1,...,\\mu_C\\) where the null does not hold, plus some information to determine \\(\\psi_c\\) and \\(\\nu_c\\) for \\(c = 1,...,C\\), how could we approximate the distribution of \\(Q\\)? We need something like a non-central Hotelling’s \\(T^2\\) distribution…"

We had a strong batch of submissions to the SIG and (since we’re new and still a fairly small group) only a few sessions to fill with them. In assembling this year’s program, Laura and I noted a few common themes that stood out to us. In this post, I’ll highlight a few of them and hopefully whet your appetite to hear more during our sessions at this year’s convention. And if you want to skip the details for now, just take a look at our handy pdf with the full SIG program."

    "text": "SIG highlights\nFirst, two of this year’s presentations deal with network meta-analysis, an approach that goes beyond a single intervention-control comparison, to instead synthesize evidence on the comparative effects of multiple alternative interventions (not just red pill vs blue pill, but also red versus green, green versus blue, etc.). Network meta-analysis is increasingly important in clinical medicine (for example, here’s a recent synthesis examining the relative efficacy of 21 different anti-depressant drugs) but it is still relatively rare in education and other social science meta-analyses. Not in this year’s SIG program though! Both our Sunday morning paper session and Monday round table feature applications of network meta-analysis: one on distance and face-to-face learning, and one on interventions for treatment of post-traumatic stress disorder.\nSecond, publication bias and other forms of outcome reporting bias remain one of the most vexing challenges for meta-analysis. Our Sunday morning paper session includes an innovative methodological study on how to detect selective outcome reporting in multi-level meta-analyses—an important setting where publication bias techniques have yet to be explored. Even with very sophisticated statistical tools, though, the best way to address publication bias is probably to try and prevent it in the first place. To that end, our Monday round table session includes a presentation on locating unreported outcome data for use in meta-analysis.\nThird, the Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analysis SIG has always included a mix of theory and practice. In this year’s program, we’ve tried to preserve that mix within each of our sessions, so that our Sunday paper session and Monday round table each include both methodological research and substantive applications of meta-analysis. We hope that this will promote interesting and valuable dialogues within our community.\nFinally, I am very excited that our business meeting will feature an address by Dr. Rebecca Maynard, who is the University Trustee Chair Professor of Education and Social Policy at the University of Pennsylvania Graduate School of Education, and an influential voice in the use of research synthesis methods to inform education and social policy. She’ll be speaking on Expanded Roles for Meta-Analysis in Supporting Evidence-Based Policy and Practice.\nBe sure to check out the SIG program for more details and other sessions of interest. I look forward to seeing everyone in Toronto!"

    "section": "",
    "text": "Selective reporting of study results is a big concern for meta-analysts. By selective reporting, we mean the phenomenon where affirmative findings—that is, statistically significant findings in the theoretically expected direction—are more likely to be reported and more likely to be available for a systematic review compared to non-affirmative findings. Selective reporting arises due to biases in the publication process, on the part of journals, editors, and reviewers, as well as strategic decisions on part of the authors (Rothstein et al., 2006; Sutton, 2009). Research synthesists worry about selective reporting because it can distort the evidence base available for meta-analysis, almost like a fun-house mirror distorts your appearance, leading to inflation of average effect size estimates and biased estimates of heterogeneity.\nIf you read the meta-analysis methods literature, you will find scores of tools available to investigate and adjust for the biases created by selective reporting. Well known and widely used methods include:\nHowever, nearly all of the statistical methods here have the limitation that they are premised on observing independent effect sizes. That presents a problem for meta-analyses in education, psychology, and other social science fields, where it is very common to have meta-analyses involving dependent effect sizes.\nDependent effects occur in meta-analyses of group comparisons when primary studies report effects for multiple correlated measures of an outcome, at multiple points in time, or for multiple treatment groups compared to the same control group (Becker, 2000). Dependent effects are also common in meta-analyses of correlational effect sizes, where primary studies report more than one relevant correlation coefficient based on the same sample of participants. Methods such as multi-level meta-analysis (Van den Noortgate et al., 2013) and robust variance estimation (Hedges et al., 2010) are available to accommodate dependent effects when summarizing findings across studies or investigating moderators of effect size using meta-regression, but these techniques have yet to be extended to methods for testing or correcting bias due to selective reporting. Consequently, it’s pretty common to see research synthesis papers that use very sophisticated models for part of the analysis, but then use kludgey, awkward, or hacky approaches when it comes time to investigating selective reporting (Rodgers & Pustejovsky, 2020).\nAlong with a group of our colleagues from the American Institutes for Research, we are currently working on a project to develop better methods for investigating selective reporting issues in meta-analyses of dependent effect sizes. In this post, we will share an early peek under the hood at one little piece of what we’re studying, by sketching out what we think is a promising and pragmatic method for examining selective reporting while also accounting for effect size dependency. The method is to use a cluster-level bootstrap, which involves re-sampling clusters of observations (i.e., the set of multiple effect size estimates reported within a given primary study) to approximate the sampling distribution of an estimator (Boos, 2003; Cameron et al., 2008). To illustrate this technique, we will demonstrate how to bootstrap a Vevea-Hedges selection model.\nSelection models comprise a large class of models that have two parts: a model describing the evidence-generation process and a model describing the process by which evidence is reported (Hedges & Vevea, 2005). Vevea-Hedges selection models (Hedges, 1992; Hedges & Vevea, 1996; Vevea & Hedges, 1995) involve a random effects meta-regression model for the evidence-generation process and a step function for the reporting process. With a step function, we assume that the probability that an effect size estimate is observed depends on the range in which its p-value falls. For instance, effects with \\(.01 &lt; p \\leq .05\\) might have some probability \\(\\lambda_1\\) of being reported, effects with \\(.05 &lt; p \\leq .10\\) might have some other probability \\(\\lambda_2\\), and effects with \\(.10 &lt; p\\) might have some other probability \\(\\lambda_3\\).1 Because the Vevea-Hedges model and other selection models separate the data-generation process into these two distinct stages, their parameters have clear interpretations and they can be used to generate bias-adjusted estimates of the distribution of effect sizes and to test for selective reporting issues. The only problem is that available implementations of selection models do not account for effect size dependency—but that’s where cluster bootstrapping could potentially help."

We’re currently studying its properties and performance using Monte Carlo simulations, but we don’t have formal results to share yet. In the spirit of open and collaborative science, we wrote this post to demonstrate our approach to coding the method, in case others would like to experiment with the technique. Given that there are so few methods available for investigating selective reporting in meta-analyses with dependent effect sizes, we think this method is worth playing with and investigating further, and we would be happy to have others try it out as well. But, if you do so, please treat the results as tentative until we learn more about when the methods work well enough to trust the results."

The cluster-robust standard error is about 27% bigger than the model-based standard error (not shown) because the latter does not account for dependent effect sizes.\nHere is a contour-enhanced funnel plot of the data:\n\n\nCode\nfunnel(RE_mod, refline = 0, level=c(90, 95, 99), shade=c(\"white\", \"gray55\", \"gray75\"))\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe funnel plot shows some asymmetry, suggesting that there is reason to be concerned about selective reporting bias in these data.\n\n\nA Selection Model\nFor starters, we will fit a very simple selection model, with a single step in the probability of reporting at \\(\\alpha = .025\\). This is what’s come to be called the three-parameter selection model (McShane et al., 2016). The step is defined in terms of a one-sided p-value, so \\(\\alpha = .025\\) corresponds to the point where an effect size estimate in the theoretically expected direction would have a regular, two-sided p-value of .05, right at the mystical threshold of statistical significance. We fit the model using metafor’s selmodel() function:\n\n\nCode\nRE_sel &lt;- selmodel(RE_mod, type = \"stepfun\", steps = .025)\nRE_sel\n\n\n\nRandom-Effects Model (k = 81; tau^2 estimator: ML)\n\ntau^2 (estimated amount of total heterogeneity): 0.0811 (SE = 0.0261)\ntau (square root of estimated tau^2 value):      0.2848\n\nTest for Heterogeneity:\nLRT(df = 1) = 37.3674, p-val &lt; .0001\n\nModel Results:\n\nestimate      se    zval    pval   ci.lb   ci.ub    \n  0.1328  0.0655  2.0267  0.0427  0.0044  0.2612  * \n\nTest for Selection Model Parameters:\nLRT(df = 1) = 1.7646, p-val = 0.1840\n\nSelection Model Results:\n\n                     k  estimate      se     zval    pval   ci.lb   ci.ub    \n0     &lt; p &lt;= 0.025  25    1.0000     ---      ---     ---     ---     ---    \n0.025 &lt; p &lt;= 1      56    0.5485  0.2495  -1.8097  0.0703  0.0594  1.0375  . \n\n---\nSignif. codes:  0 '***' 0.001 '**' 0.01 '*' 0.05 '.' 0.1 ' ' 1\n\n\nThe selection parameter represents the probability that an effect size estimate that is not in the theoretically expected direction or not statistically significant at the conventional level would be included in the synthesis, relative to the probability that an affirmative, statistically significant effect size estimate would be included. In this example, the probability of selection is estimated as 0.55, meaning only about 55% of the non-significant results that we would expect were generated are actually reported. Adjusting for this selection bias, the model estimates an overall average effect size of 0.13 SD—smaller than the unadjusted random effects estimate—with heterogeneity of \\(\\hat\\tau = 0.28\\).\nThe problem with this analysis is that the selection model is set up under the assumption that the effect size estimates are all independent. As a result, the reported standard errors are probably smaller than they should be and the confidence intervals are narrower than they should be. We’ll use cluster bootstrapping to get standard errors and confidence intervals that should better account for effect size dependency."

    "text": "Cluster Bootstrapping a Selection Model\nIn R, the boot package provides tools for running a variety of different bootstrap techniques and obtaining confidence intervals based on bootstrap distributions (Canty & Ripley, 2021). It’s been around for ages and has some very nice features, but it requires a bit of trickery to use it for cluster bootstrapping. The main challenge is that the package functionality is set up under the assumption that every row of the dataset should be treated as an independent observation. To make it work for cluster bootstrapping, we will need a function to fit the selection model, which takes in a dataset with one row per cluster and returns a vector of parameter estimates. The function also has to have an index argument which is a vector of row indexes used to create the bootstrap sample. Here is a skeleton for such a function:\n\n\nCode\nfit_selmodel &lt;- function(\n    dat,   # dataset with one row per cluster\n    index, # vector of indexes used to create the bootstrap sample\n    ...    # any further arguments\n) { \n  \n  # take subset of data\n  boot_dat &lt;- dat[index,]\n  \n  # fit selection model\n  \n  # compile parameter estimates into a vector\n  \n}\n\n\n\nClustering and unclustering\nThe Lehmann dataset has one row per effect size, sometimes with multiple rows per study, so we need to modify the data to have one row per study. There are at least two ways to accomplish this. One option is to create a dataset consisting only of study-level IDs, then merge it back on to the full data to get the effect-size level data:\n\n\nCode\n# Make a dataset of study IDs\ncluster_IDs &lt;- data.frame(study = unique(lehmann_dat$study))\n\nglimpse(cluster_IDs)\n\n\nRows: 41\nColumns: 1\n$ study &lt;chr&gt; \"Banas, 2014 \", \"Berthold, 2013 \", \"Bigelow et al., 2013 \", \"Ble…\n\n\nCode\n# Merge with full data\nfull_dat &lt;- merge(cluster_IDs, lehmann_dat, by = \"study\")\n\nfull_dat %&gt;% select(study, yi, vi) %&gt;% glimpse()\n\n\nRows: 81\nColumns: 3\n$ study &lt;chr&gt; \"Banas, 2014 \", \"Berthold, 2013 \", \"Bigelow et al., 2013 \", \"Big…\n$ yi    &lt;dbl&gt; 0.05716727, 0.55411916, 0.31467980, -0.73259462, 0.07921700, -0.…\n$ vi    &lt;dbl&gt; 0.10267348, 0.06030579, 0.29520322, 0.53354343, 0.02692608, 0.05…\n\n\nAnother option is to use the dplyr::nest_by() function to nest the data by cluster (Wickham et al., 2019). Then, we can use tidyr::unnest() to recover the effect size level data (Wickham et al., 2019). Like so:\n\n\nCode\n# Nest the data for each study\nlehmann_nested &lt;- nest_by(lehmann_dat, study, .key = \"data\")\n\nglimpse(lehmann_nested)\n\n\nRows: 41\nColumns: 2\nRowwise: study\n$ study &lt;chr&gt; \"Banas, 2014 \", \"Berthold, 2013 \", \"Bigelow et al., 2013 \", \"Ble…\n$ data  &lt;list&lt;tibble[,49]&gt;&gt; [&lt;tbl_df[1 x 49]&gt;], [&lt;tbl_df[1 x 49]&gt;], [&lt;tbl_df[2…\n\n\nCode\n# Recover the full dataset\nfull_dat &lt;-\n  lehmann_nested %&gt;%\n  unnest(data)\n\nfull_dat %&gt;% select(study, yi, vi) %&gt;% glimpse()\n\n\nRows: 81\nColumns: 3\nGroups: study [41]\n$ study &lt;chr&gt; \"Banas, 2014 \", \"Berthold, 2013 \", \"Bigelow et al., 2013 \", \"Big…\n$ yi    &lt;dbl&gt; 0.05716727, 0.55411916, 0.31467980, -0.73259462, 0.07921700, -0.…\n$ vi    &lt;dbl&gt; 0.10267348, 0.06030579, 0.29520322, 0.53354343, 0.02692608, 0.05…\n\n\nWe will follow the latter strategy for the remainder of our example.\nWith this nest-and-unnest approach, we can fill in a little bit more of our function skeleton:\n\n\nCode\nfit_selmodel &lt;- function(\n    dat,   # dataset with one row per cluster\n    index, # vector of indexes used to create the bootstrap sample\n    ...    # any further arguments\n) { \n  \n  # take subset of data\n  boot_dat_cluster &lt;- dat[index, ]\n  \n  # expand to one row per effect size\n  boot_dat &lt;- tidyr::unnest(boot_dat_cluster, data)\n  \n  # fit selection model\n  \n  # compile parameter estimates into a vector\n  \n}\n\n\n\n\nSelection model function\nNext, we need to complete the function by writing code to fit the selection model. This is a little bit involved because of the way the metafor package implements the Vevea-Hedges selection model. We first need to fit a regular random effects model using metafor::rma.uni(), then pass the result to the metafor::selmodel() function to fit a selection model, and then pull out the parameter estimates as a vector. To make the code clearer, we will move this step out into its own function:\n\n\nCode\nrun_sel_model &lt;- function(dat, steps = .025) {\n  \n  # initial random effects model\n  RE_mod &lt;- metafor::rma.uni(\n      yi = yi, vi = vi, data = dat, method = \"ML\"\n  )\n  \n  # fit selection model\n  res &lt;- metafor::selmodel(\n    RE_mod, type = \"stepfun\", steps = steps,\n    skiphes = TRUE, # turn off SE calculation\n    skiphet = TRUE # turn off heterogeneity test\n  )\n  \n  # compile parameter estimates into a vector\n  c(beta = res$beta[,1], tau = sqrt(res$tau2), delta = res$delta[-1])\n  \n}\n\n\nNote the use of skiphes and skiphet arguments in the selmodel() call, which skip the calculation of standard errors and skip the calculation of the test for heterogeneity. We don’t need the standard errors here because we’re going to use bootstrapping instead, and we’re not interested in the heterogeneity test. Turning off these calculations saves computational time.\nA further complication with fitting a selection model is that the parameter estimates are obtained by maximum likelihood, using an iterative optimization algorithm that sometimes fails to converge. To handle non-convergence, we will pass our function through purrr::possibly() so that errors are suppressed, rather than causing everything to grind to a halt (Wickham et al., 2019). We set the otherwise argument so that non-convergent results are returned as NA values:\n\n\nCode\nrun_sel_model &lt;- purrr::possibly(run_sel_model, otherwise = rep(NA_real_, 3))\n\n\n\n\nA first bootstrap\nHere is the completed fitting function called fit_selmodel():\n\n\nCode\nfit_selmodel &lt;- function(dat, \n                         index = 1:nrow(dat), \n                         steps = 0.025) {\n  \n  # take subset of data\n  boot_dat_cluster &lt;- dat[index, ]\n  \n  # expand to one row per effect size\n  boot_dat &lt;- tidyr::unnest(boot_dat_cluster, data)\n  \n  # fit selection model, return vector\n  run_sel_model(boot_dat, steps = steps)\n  \n}\n\n\nFirst, we take a subset of the data based on the index argument. This generates a bootstrap sample from the original data based on re-sampled clusters. We then use tidyr::unnest() to get the effect size level data for those re-sampled clusters. We then re-fit the model using our run_sel_model() function.\nNow let’s apply our function to the Lehmann dataset. We will first need to create a nested version of the dataset, with one row per study:\n\n\nCode\nlehmann_nested &lt;- nest_by(lehmann_dat, study, .key = \"data\")\n\n\nNow we can fit the selection model using fit_sel_model():\n\n\nCode\nfit_selmodel(lehmann_nested)\n\n\nbeta.intrcpt          tau        delta \n   0.1327996    0.2848304    0.5484541 \n\n\nThe results reproduce what we saw earlier when we estimated the three parameter selection model.\nNow we can bootstrap using the boot::boot() function. The inputs to boot() are the nested dataset, the function to fit the selection model, and then any additional arguments passed to fit_selmodel()—here we include an argument for steps—and finally, the number of bootstrap replications:\n\n\nCode\n# Generate bootstrap\nset.seed(20230321)\n\ntic()\n\nboots &lt;- boot(\n  data = lehmann_nested,            # nested dataset\n  statistic = fit_selmodel,         # function for fitting selection model\n  steps = .025,                     # further arguments to the fitting function\n  R = 1999                          # number of bootstraps\n)\n\ntime_seq &lt;- toc()\n\n\n141.64 sec elapsed\n\n\nThis code takes a while to run, but we can speed it up with parallel processing.\n\n\nParallel processing\nThe boot package has some handy parallel processing features, but they can be a bit finicky to use here because of how R manages environments across multiple processes. With the above code, we can’t simply turn on parallel processing because the worker processes won’t know where to find the run_sel_model() function that gets called inside fit_selmodel(). To fix this, we include the run_sel_model() function inside our fitting function, as follows:\n\n\nCode\nfit_selmodel &lt;- function(dat, \n                         index = 1:nrow(dat), \n                         steps = 0.025) {\n  \n  # take subset of data\n  boot_dat_cluster &lt;- dat[index, ]\n  \n  # expand to one row per effect size\n  boot_dat &lt;- tidyr::unnest(boot_dat_cluster, data)\n  \n  # build run_selmodel\n  run_sel_model &lt;- function(dat, steps = .025) {\n  \n    # initial random effects model\n    RE_mod &lt;- metafor::rma.uni(\n      yi = yi, vi = vi, data = dat, method = \"ML\"\n    )\n    \n    # fit selection model\n    res &lt;- metafor::selmodel(\n      RE_mod, type = \"stepfun\", steps = steps,\n      skiphes = TRUE, # turn off SE calculation\n      skiphet = TRUE # turn off heterogeneity test\n    )\n    \n    # compile parameter estimates into a vector\n    c(beta = res$beta[,1], tau = sqrt(res$tau2), delta = res$delta[-1])\n    \n  }\n  \n  p &lt;- 2L + length(steps)  # calculate total number of model parameters\n  \n  # error handling for run_sel_model\n  run_sel_model &lt;- purrr::possibly(run_sel_model, otherwise = rep(NA_real_, p))\n  \n  # fit selection model, return vector of parameter estimates\n  run_sel_model(boot_dat, steps = steps)\n  \n}\n\n\nNow we can call boot() with options for parallel processing. The machine we used to compile this post has 12 cores. We will use half of the available cores for parallel processing. The configuration of parallel processing will depend on your operating system (different options are available for Mac), so you may need to adapt this code a bit.\n\n\nCode\nncpus &lt;- parallel::detectCores() / 2\n\n# Generate bootstrap\nset.seed(20230321)\n\ntic()\n\nboots &lt;- boot(\n  data = lehmann_nested,\n  statistic = fit_selmodel, steps = .025,\n  R = 1999,\n  parallel = \"snow\", ncpus = ncpus # parallel processing options\n)\n\ntime_par &lt;- toc()\n\n\n49.61 sec elapsed\n\n\nParallel processing is really helpful here. We get 2000 bootstraps in 50 seconds, 2.9 times faster than sequential processing.\n\n\nStandard Errors\nThe standard deviations of the bootstrapped parameter estimates can be interpreted as standard errors for the parameter estimates that take into account the dependence structure of the effect size estimates. Here is a table comparing the cluster-bootstrapped standard errors to the model-based standard errors generated by selmodel():\n\n\nCode\nest &lt;- boots$t0 # original parameter estimates\n\n# calculate bootstrap SEs\nboot_SE &lt;- apply(boots$t, 2, sd, na.rm = TRUE)  \n\n# calculate model-based SEs\nmodel_SE &lt;- with(RE_sel, c(se, se.tau2 / (2 * sqrt(tau2)), se.delta[-1]))\n\n# make a table\nres &lt;- tibble(\n  Parameter = names(est),\n  Est = est,\n  `SE(bootstrap)` = boot_SE,\n  `SE(model)` = model_SE,\n  `SE(bootstrap) / SE(model)` = boot_SE / model_SE\n)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nParameter\nEst\nSE(bootstrap)\nSE(model)\nSE(bootstrap) / SE(model)\n\n\n\n\nbeta.intrcpt\n0.133\n0.113\n0.066\n1.732\n\n\ntau\n0.285\n0.148\n0.046\n3.234\n\n\ndelta\n0.548\n0.780\n0.250\n3.127\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe standard errors based on cluster bootstrapping are all substantially larger than the model-based standard errors, which don’t account for dependence.\n\n\nConfidence Intervals\nFor reporting results from this sort of analysis, it is useful to provide confidence intervals along with the model parameter estimates and standard errors. These can be calculated using the boot::boot_ci() function. This function provides several different types of confidence intervals; for illustration, we will stick with simple percentile confidence intervals, which are calculated by taking percentiles of the bootstrap distribution of each parameter estimate. To use the function, we’ll specify the type of confidence interval and the index of the parameter we want. An index of 1 is for the overall average effect size:\n\n\nCode\nboot.ci(boots, type = \"perc\", index = 1) # For overall average ES\n\n\nBOOTSTRAP CONFIDENCE INTERVAL CALCULATIONS\nBased on 1995 bootstrap replicates\n\nCALL : \nboot.ci(boot.out = boots, type = \"perc\", index = 1)\n\nIntervals : \nLevel     Percentile     \n95%   (-0.0038,  0.4171 )  \nCalculations and Intervals on Original Scale\n\n\nHere is the confidence interval for between-study heterogeneity:\n\n\nCode\nboot.ci(boots, type = \"perc\", index = 2) # For heterogeneity\n\n\nBOOTSTRAP CONFIDENCE INTERVAL CALCULATIONS\nBased on 1995 bootstrap replicates\n\nCALL : \nboot.ci(boot.out = boots, type = \"perc\", index = 2)\n\nIntervals : \nLevel     Percentile     \n95%   ( 0.001,  0.489 )  \nCalculations and Intervals on Original Scale\n\n\nAnd for the selection weight:\n\n\nCode\nboot.ci(boots, type = \"perc\", index = 3) # For selection weight\n\n\nBOOTSTRAP CONFIDENCE INTERVAL CALCULATIONS\nBased on 1995 bootstrap replicates\n\nCALL : \nboot.ci(boot.out = boots, type = \"perc\", index = 3)\n\nIntervals : \nLevel     Percentile     \n95%   ( 0.0574,  2.7536 )  \nCalculations and Intervals on Original Scale\n\n\nPercentile confidence intervals can be asymmetric, and here the confidence interval for the selection weight parameter is notably asymmetric. The end-points of the confidence interval range from 0.057 (which represents very strong selective reporting, with only 6% of non-significant results reported) to 2.754 (which represents very strong selection against affirmative results).2 So, overall we can’t really draw any strong conclusions about the strength of selective reporting."

    "text": "Conclusion\nIn this post, we’ve demonstrated how to code a cluster-level bootstrap for a three parameter version of the Vevea-Hedges selection model. We think this cluster-bootstrapping technique is interesting and promising because it can be applied with a very broad swath of models and methods to investigate selective reporting. For instance, the code we’ve demonstrated could be modified by:\n\nusing a meta-regression model instead of just a summary meta-analysis;\nusing a different form of selection function such as the beta-weight model proposed by Citkowicz and Vevea (2017) or a more elaborate step function with multiple steps; or\nusing a step function model applied across subsets of effect sizes, as in Coburn & Vevea (2015).\n\nThe metafor package implements an expansive set of selection models with the selmodel function, so one could really just swap specifications in and out. In principle, the cluster-level bootstrap could also be used in combination with other forms of selective reporting analysis such as PET-PEESE (although with such regression adjustments, cluster-robust variance estimation is also an option, see Rodgers & Pustejovsky, 2020) or Copas-style sensitivity analyses (Copas & Shi, 2001).\nWe are currently studying the performance of bootstrapping a three parameter selection model in some big Monte Carlo simulations. Based on some very preliminary results, it looks like the cluster bootstrapped selection model provides confidence intervals with reasonable coverage levels. We have more to do before we share these results, so again we want to emphasize that what we have demonstrated in this post is experimental and exploratory.\nFurther questions we need to investigate are how things work if we include covariates in the selection model, whether there are better variations of the bootstrap than what we have demonstrated here (e.g., the fractionally weighted bootstrapping, Xu et al., 2020), and the limits of this method in terms of the number of studies needed for adequate performance. If things pan out, we also plan to turn the workflow we’ve demonstrated here into some more user-friendly functions, perhaps as part of the wildmeta package."
