The method is to use a cluster-level bootstrap, which involves re-sampling clusters of observations to approximate the sampling distribution of an estimator. To illustrate this technique, we will demonstrate how to bootstrap a Vevea-Hedges selection model.\n\n\n\n\n\nMar 30, 2023\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCohen’s \\(d_z\\) makes me dizzy when considering measurement error\n\n\n\n\n\n\neffect size\n\n\nstandardized mean difference\n\n\ndesign-comparable SMD\n\n\nmeasurement-error\n\n\n\nMeta-analyses in education, psychology, and related fields rely heavily of Cohen’s \\(d\\), or the standardized mean difference effect size, for quantitatively describing the magnitude and direction of intervention effects. In these fields, Cohen’s \\(d\\) is so pervasive that its use is nearly automatic, and analysts rarely question its utility or consider alternatives (response ratios, anyone? POMP?). Despite this state of affairs, working with Cohen’s \\(d\\) is theoretically challenging because the standardized mean difference metric does not have a singular definition. Rather, its definition depends on the choice of the standardizing variance used in the denominator.\n\n\n\n\n\nFeb 17, 2023\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCorrigendum to Pustejovsky and Tipton (2018), redux\n\n\nA revised version of Theorem 2\n\n\n\nrobust variance estimation\n\n\neconometrics\n\n\nmatrix algebra\n\n\n\nIn my 2018 paper with Beth Tipton, published in the Journal of Business and Economic Statistics, we considered how to do cluster-robust variance estimation in fixed effects models estimated by weighted (or unweighted) least squares. We were recently alerted that Theorem 2 in the paper is incorrect as stated. It turns out, the conditions in the original version of the theorem are too general. A more limited version of the Theorem does actually hold, but only for models estimated using ordinary (unweighted) least squares, under a working model that assumes independent, homoskedastic errors. In this post, I’ll give the revised theorem, following the notation and setup of the previous post (so better read that first, or what follows won’t make much sense!).\n\n\n\n\n\nNov 7, 2022\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCorrigendum to Pustejovsky and Tipton (2018)\n\n\nTheorem 2 is incorrect as stated\n\n\n\nrobust variance estimation\n\n\neconometrics\n\n\nmatrix algebra\n\n\n\nIn my 2018 paper with Beth Tipton, published in the Journal of Business and Economic Statistics, we considered how to do cluster-robust variance estimation in fixed effects models estimated by weighted (or unweighted) least squares. A careful reader recently alerted us to a problem with Theorem 2 in the paper, which concerns a computational short cut for a certain cluster-robust variance estimator in models with cluster-specific fixed effects. The theorem is incorrect as stated, and we are currently working on issuing a correction for the published version of the paper. In the interim, this post details the problem with Theorem 2. I’ll first review the CR2 variance estimator, then describe the assertion of the theorem, and then provide a numerical counter-example demonstrating that the assertion is not correct as stated.\n\n\n\n\n\nSep 28, 2022\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nVariance component estimates in meta-analysis with mis-specified sampling correlation\n\n\n\n\n\n\nmeta-analysis\n\n\ndependent effect sizes\n\n\ndistribution theory\n\n\nhierarchical models\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNov 28, 2021\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nImplications of mean-variance relationships for standardized mean differences\n\n\n\n\n\n\nstandardized mean difference\n\n\nresponse ratio\n\n\ndistribution theory\n\n\nmeta-analysis\n\n\n\nA question came up on the R-SIG-meta-analysis listserv about whether it was reasonable to use the standardized mean difference metric for synthesizing studies where the outcomes are measured as proportions. I think this is an interesting question because, while the SMD could work perfectly fine as an effect size metric for proportions, there are also other alternatives that could be considered, such as odds ratios or response ratios or raw differences in proportions. Further, there are some situations where the SMD has disadvantages for synthesizing contrasts between proportions. Thus, it’s a situation where one has to make a choice about the effect size metric, and where the most common metric (the SMD) might not be the right answer. In this post, I want to provide a bit more detail regarding why I think mean-variance relationships in raw data can signal that the standardized mean differences might be less useful as an effect size metric compared to alternatives.\n\n\n\n\n\nNov 2, 2021\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nInverting partitioned matrices\n\n\n\n\n\n\nmatrix algebra\n\n\n\nThere’s lots of linear algebra out there that’s quite useful for statistics, but that I never learned in school or never had cause to study in depth. In the same spirit as my previous post on the Woodbury identity, I thought I would share my notes on another helpful bit of math about matrices. At some point in high school or college, you might have learned how to invert a small matrix by hand. It turns out that there’s a straight-forward generalization of this formula to matrices of arbitrary size, but that are partitioned into four pieces.\n\n\n\n\n\nOct 20, 2021\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nStandardized mean differences in single-group, repeated measures designs\n\n\n\n\n\n\neffect size\n\n\nstandardized mean difference\n\n\ndistribution theory\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOct 6, 2021\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFinding the distribution of significant effect sizes\n\n\nIn a study reporting multiple outcomes\n\n\n\neffect size\n\n\ndistribution theory\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nApr 27, 2021\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe Woodbury identity\n\n\nA life-hack for analyzing hierarchical models\n\n\n\nhierarchical models\n\n\nmatrix algebra\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDec 4, 2020\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAn ANCOVA puzzler\n\n\n\n\n\n\nmeta-analysis\n\n\neffect size\n\n\nstandardized mean difference\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNov 24, 2020\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFrom Longhorn to Badger\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAug 28, 2020\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWhat do meta-analysts mean by ‘multivariate’ meta-analysis?\n\n\n\n\n\n\nmeta-analysis\n\n\nmultivariate\n\n\ndependent effect sizes\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nJun 27, 2020\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWeighting in multivariate meta-analysis\n\n\n\n\n\n\nmeta-analysis\n\n\nweighting\n\n\n\nOne common question about multivariate/multi-level meta-analysis is how such models assign weight to individual effect size estimates. When a version of the question came up recently on the R-sig-meta-analysis listserv, Dr. Wolfgang Viechtbauer offered a whole blog post in reply, demonstrating how weights work in simpler fixed effect and random effects meta-analysis and then how things get more complicated in multivariate models. In this post, I’ll try to add some further intuition on how weights work in certain multivariate meta-analysis models. Most of the discussion will apply to models that include multiple level of random effects, but no predictors. I’ll also comment briefly on meta-regression models with only study-level predictor variables, and finally give some pointers to work on more complicated models.\n\n\n\n\n\nJun 9,
