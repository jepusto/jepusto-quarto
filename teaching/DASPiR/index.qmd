title: Data Analysis, Simulation, and Programming in R
place: UT Austin
---

This course provides training in using the open-source statistical programming environment called R to accomplish 1) real-world, reproducible data analysis and 2) design and implementation of statistical simulations, which are an important tool for evaluating the performance of statistical estimation and inference procedures. Topics covered include:

* the logic of Râ€™s primary data structures and how to work with functions
* tools and best practices for accessing, cleaning, and manipulating data
* reproducibility as a fundamental tenet of high-quality data analysis
* data visualization techniques 
* selected statistical models and methods that are useful for data-analysis, including linear regression models and generalized linear models. 

Content relevant to designing and implementing Monte Carlo simulation studies is interwoven throughout the course.
