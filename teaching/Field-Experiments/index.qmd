title: Field Experiments in Education Research
place: UW Madison
---

This course will cover the design, analysis, and interpretation of randomized field experiments in education research. We will examine the theoretical, statistical, and pragmatic considerations involved in such studies, from articulating a theory of change and selecting outcome measurements, to choosing an experimental design and analytic strategy, to addressing questions of generalizability. Our focus will be on designs most commonly used in educational settings, such as block-randomized or cluster-randomized experiments, and the implementation challenges that arise in such settings, such as non-compliance, attrition, and interference. By the end of the course, students should be able to contribute to the design and planning of a randomized experiment in a realistic field setting, to critically assess reported findings from field experiments, and to make informed judgments about the role of randomized field experiments within education research.
