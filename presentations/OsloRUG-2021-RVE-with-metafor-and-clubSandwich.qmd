Large meta-analyses often involve dependent effect sizes, but where the exact form of the dependence is unknown. Meta-analysis with robust variance estimation handles this problem through specification of a working model for the dependence, which need not be correct. However, the two currently available working models are limited to each describing a single type of dependence. James will demonstrate a workflow for implementing an expanded set of working models by combining the metafor and clubSandwich R packages.
